O F

Robinson Crusoe, &V.

i| Was born in the Year 11*32, in the
City of Tork, of a good Family, tho*
not of that Country, my Fathet be-
inga Foreigner of B.tmtn, who fettled
I firft at Hull: He got a good Eflate
by Merchandize, and leaving off his
Trade, lived ar:erwardat2oi-A, from whence hehad
married my Mother, whofe Relations were mined
Bebinfon, a very good Family in that Country, and
from whom I was called Robinfm Kreutzjia?r ; but by
the ufual Corruption of Words in England, we are
now called, nay we call out felves, and write our
NamcCr»/«,andf6 my Companions always call'd me,
B IfcaA




,- — f 2r 1

I had twd elder Brothers, one of which was
Lieutenant-Collonel to an Engljjh Regiment of Foot
in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous
Col. Lockharty and was killed at the Battle near Dun*
Jdrjk againft the Spaniards : What became of my fe-
* conaBrother I never knew, any more than my Fa-
ther or Mother did know what was become of me.

Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred
to any Trade, my Head began to be fill'd very
early with rambling Thoughts : My Father, who
wafc very ancient, had given me a competent Share
of Learning, as far as Houfe-Education, and a
Country Free-School generally goes, and defignM
me for the Law ; but I would be fatisfied with no-
thing but going to Sea, and my Inclination to this
led me fo ftrongly acainft the Will, nay, the Com-
mands of my Father, and againft all the Entreaties
and Perfuauons of my Mother, and other Friends,
that there feem'd to be fomething fatal in that
propenfion of Nature tending dire&ly towards
the Life of Mifery which was to befal me.

My. Father, a wife and grave Man, gave me
ferious apd excetfetat Counfel againft what he fore-
faw was my Defign. He called me one Morning in-
to his Chamber, where he was confined by the
Gout, and expoftillated very warmly with me upon
this Subject: He ask'd me what Reafons more than
a meer wandririg Inclination I had for leaving my
Father's Houfe and my native Country, where I
might be well introduced, and had a Profpeft
of" raifing my Fortune by Application and In-
duftry, with a Life of Eafe and Pleafure. He
told me it was for Men of defperate Fortunes on
one Hand, or of afpirin^, fuperior Fortunes on the
other, who went abroad upon Adventures, to rife
by Enterprize, and make themfelves famous in Un-
dertakings of a Nature out of the common Road ;

that

that thefe Things were all either too far above me*
or to far below me ; that mine was the middle
State, or what might be called the upper Station
oiLow Life j which he had found by long Experi-
ence was the beft State in the World, the mod
fuited to human Happinefs, not expofed to the Mi-
feries and Hardships, the Labour and Sufferings of
the mechanic k Part of Mankind, and not emba-
rafs'd with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and En-
vy of the upper Part of Mankind. He told me, I
might judge of the Happinefs of this State, by this
one thing* viz,. That this was the State ot Life
which all other People envied ; that Kings have
frequently lamented the miferable Confequences of
being born to great Things, and wifh they had
fyeen placed in the Middle of the two Extremes,
between the Mean and the Great; that the wife
Man gave his Teftimony to this as the juft Standard
of true Felicity, when he prayed to have neither
Poverty or Riches.

He bid me obferve it, and I fhould always find,
that the Calamities of Life were {bared among the
upper and lower Part of Mankind ; but that the
middle Station had the feweft Difafters, and was
not expos/J to fo many Viciffitudes as the higher or
lower Part of Mankind ; nay* they were not fubje-
cted to fo many Dirtempers and Uneafinefles either
of Body or Mind, as thofe were, who by vicious
Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one Hand,
or by hard Labour, wantofNeceflaries, and mean
or iniufficient Diet on the other Hand, bring Di*
ftempers upon chemfelves by the natural Confequen-
ces of their Way of Living ,• That the middle Sta-
tion of Life was calculated for all kind of Virtues
and all kind of Enjoyments ; that Peace and Plen-
ty were the Hand- maids of a middle Fortune ;
that Temperance, Moderation, Qjiietnefs, Health,

B a Soci-

Sodety, all agreeable Diverfions, and all defirable
Plcafurtsj were the Bleflings attending the middle
Station of-Life y that this Way Men went filently
and ftfobfhly thro* the World, and comfortably out
dif it; ndt embarafs'd with the Labours of the
Hirids dr 6f the Head, not fold to the Life of Sla-
very T6p daily Bread 1 , or*harrafs'd with perplex'd
Cifcumftances which rob the Soul of Peace, and
thfe Body of Ifeft ; not enrag'd with the Paffion of
Envy/ or fecret burning Luft of Ambition for great
Things ; but in eafy Circumftances Aiding gently
thro* the World, and fcnfibly tafting the Sweets of
living, without the bitter, feeling that they are
happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to
know it more fenfibly.

After this he prefs'd me earneftly, and in the
moft affe&ionatc manner, not to play the young
Man, not to precipitate my felf into Miferies which
Nature and the Station of Life I was born in,
feem'd to have provided againft ,• that I was under
no Neceffity of feeking my Bread ,• that he would
do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly
into the Station of Life which he had been juft re-
commending to me ; and that if I was not very ea-
fy and happy in the World, it muft be my meer
Fate or Fault that muft hinder it, and that he
fhould have nothing to anfwer for, having thus dif-
charg'd his Duty in warning me againft Meafures
which, he knew would be to my Hurt : In a word,
that as he would do very kind Things for me
if I would ftay and fettle at Home as he dire&ed,
fo he would not have fo much Hand in my Misfor-
tunes, as to give me any Encouragement to go
away : And to clofe all, he told me, I had my
elder Brother for an Example, to whom he had ufed
the fame earneft Perfuafions to keep him from go*
ing into the Low-County Wars, but cou'd not pre-

vail, his young Defires prompting him to run into
the Armv where he was kill'd ; and tho' he faid
he would not ceafe to pray for me, yet he would
-venture to fay to me, that if I did take this foolifo
Step, God would not bleis me, and I would have
Lcifure hereafter to refled upon having negle&od
his Counfel, when there might be none to affift in
my Recovery.

I obferved in this laft Part of his Difcourfe,
which was truly Prophetick, tho* I fuppofe my
Father did not know it to be fo himfelf ; I fay, I
O.bfervcd the Tears run down his Face very plen-
tifully, and efpecially when hp fpoke of my Brother
who was kill'd ,* and that when he fpoke of my ha-
ying Leifure to repent, and none to aflift me, he
was fo mov'd, that h$ broke off the Difcourfe, and
. told me, his Heart was fo full, he could fay no
more to me.

I -was fincerdy affeded with this Difcourfe, 3s
indeed who could be otherwife ? and I refolv'd not
to think of going Abroad any more, but to fettle
at Home according to my Father's Defire. But a-
lafs ! a few Days wore it all off; and in fliort, tp
prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, J refolv'd to run quite away
from him. However, I did not aft fo haftily neither
as my firft Heat of Rcfolution prompted, but I
took my Mother, at a Tjme when J thought her a
litt e pleafanter than ordinary, and told her, that
my Thoughts were fo entirely bent upon feeirtg die
World, that I fliould never fettle tp any thing witji
Refolution enough to go through with it, and my
Father had better give me his Confent than force
me to go without it ; that I was now eighteen
Years old, which was too late to go Apprentice to
a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney ,' that I was fure
if I did, I fliould never ferve out my Time, and I

B 3 fliould



Jhoirfd Certainly run away from my Mafter befora
my Time was our, and go ' ro Sea ; and if (he would
jpeak to my Father to let mc go one Voyage a-
broad, if I came home again and did hot like it, I
would go no more, and I would promife* by a dou-
ble Diligence to recover that Time I had loft.
• This put my Mother into a great Paflion : She
told me, (he knew it wopld be to no Purpofe to
fpeak to my Father upon any fuch Subjeft ; that he
knew too well what was my Intereft to give his
Confent to any fuch Thing fo much for my Hurt*
and thatfhe wondered how I could think of any fuch
'thing' after fuch a Difcbuttfe as I had had with my
Father,' and fuch kind and tender Expreffions as fhe
^knew my Father had us J d to me ,• and that in fliort,
if I woitld ruin my felf, there was no Help forme;
but I might depend I fhonld never have their Con-
fent to it : That for her Part fhe would not ha\ r e fo
xnocH Hand in my Deftru&ion ; and I ftiould never
have it to fay, that my Mother was willing when
iiy Father was not.

'' Tho* my Mother refiifed to move it to my Father,
yet as I have heard afterwards, fhe reported all the
; JDifcourfe to him, and that my Father, after fhewing
a great Concern at it, faid to her with a Sigh, That
Jioy might be happy if he would ftay at home, but if
he goes abroad, he will be the molt miferableft
.Wretch that ever was born: I can give no Confent

tp it.

It was not till almoft a Year after this that I broke
loofe, tho* in the mean time I continued obftinately
deaf to all Propofals of fettling to Bufinefs, and fre-
quently expoftulating with my Father and Mother,
about their being fo pofitively determined againft
what they knew my Inclinations prompted me to.
But being one Day ar Hull, where I went cafually,
and without any Purpofe of making an Elopement

' - that



m

that time ; but I fay, being there, and one of my
Companions being going by Sea to London, in his
Father's Ship, and prompting me to go with them,
with the common Allurement of Seafaring Men,w&.
That it fhould coft me nothing for my Paffage, I
confulted neither Father nor Mother any more, nor
fo much as fent them Word of it ; but leaving them
to hear of it as they might, without asking God's
Blefling, or my Father's, without any Confideration
of Circumftances or Confequences,and in an ill Hour*
God knows, on the firft of September 1651, I went
on Board a Ship bound for* London • Never any young
Adventurer's Misfortunes, I believe, began fooner,
or continued longer than mine. The Ship was no
fooner gotten out of the Huntber, but the Wind be-
gan to blow, and the Sea to rife in a mod frightful
manner ; and as I had never been at Sea before, I was
moil inexpreffibly fick inBody^andterrify'din Mind:
I began now ferioufly to reflect upon what I had
done, and how juftly I was overtaken by the Judg-
ment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my Father's
Houfe, and abandoning my Duty ; all the good
Counfel of my Parents, my Father's Tears, and my
Mother's Entreaties came now frefli into my Mind;
and my Confcience, which was not yet come to the
Pitch of Hardnefs to which it has been fince, ret
proach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the
Breach of my Duty to God and my Father.

All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the SeaJ
which I had never been upon before,went very high,
tho* nothing like what I have feen many times
fince ; no, nor like what I faw a few Days after s
But it was enough to affeft me then, who was but
a young Sailor, and had never known any tiling of
the Matter. I expe&ed every Wave would have
f wallowed us up, and that every time the Ship fell
down, as I thought, in the Trough. 0( {fallow

of the Sea, we fliould never rife more ; and in thi$
Agony of Mind, I made many Vows and Resolu-
tions, that if it would pleafe God here to fpare
my Life this one Voyage, if ever I got once my
Foot upon dry Land again, I would go dire&ly
home to my Father, and never fet it into a Ship a-
gain while I liv'd; that I would take his Advice,
and: never run my felf into fuch Miferies as thefe a-*
ny more. Now I faw plainly the Goodnefs of his
Obfervations about the middle Station of Life,
how eafy, how comfortably he had liv'd all his
Days, and never had been exposed to Tempers at
Sea, or Troubles on Shore ; and I refolv'd that I
would, like z true repenting Prodigal, go home to
my Father. .

' . Thefe wife and fober Thoughts continued all the
while the Storm continued, and indeed fome time
after ; but the next Day the Wind was.abated and
the Sea calmer, and I began to be a little innur'd
to it : However, I was very grave for all that Day,
being alfo a little Sea fick ftill ; but towards. Night
the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over,
a charming fine Evening follow'd ; the Sun went
down perteftly clear, and rofe fo the next Morn-
ing ; and having little or no Wind, and a fmooth
Sea, the Sun Aiming upon it, the S.'ght was, as I
thought, the moft delightful that ever I faw.

I had flept well in the Night, and was now no
more Sca_fick, but very chearful, looking with
Wonder upon the Sea that was fo rough and terri-
ble the Day before, and could be fo calm and fo
pleafant in fo little time after. And now leaft my
good Refolutionsfhould continue, my Companion,
who had indeed entie'd me away, comes to me,
Well, Bob, fays he, clapping me on the Shoulder,
How do you do after it ? I warrant you were frighted,
wdnt you laft Night > when it blew hut a CapjuB of

Wind ? A Caf full d'you caU it ? faid I, 'twas a terrh
bit Storm : A Storm, you Fool you, replies he, doym
call that a Storm, why it was nothing at all ; give us but
a good Ship and Sea-room, and we think nothing ojfucb
a Squall of Wind as that ; but you re but afrejb Water
Sailor, Bob ; come let us make a Bowl oj Punch and
we'll forget all that, d'ye fee what charming Weather 'tk
now. To make fhort this fad Part of my Story,
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch was
made, and I was made drunk with it, and in that
one Night's Wickednefs I drowned all my Repen-
tance, all my Reflexions upbn my paft Conduft;
and all my Refolutions for my future. In a word,
as the Sea was returned to its Smoothnefs of Sur-
face and fettled Calmnefs by the Abatement of that
Storm, fo the Hurry of my Thoughts being over,
my Fears and Apprehenfions of being fwallow'd up
by the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of my
former Defires return'd, I entirely forgot the Vows
and Promifes that I made in my Diftrefs. I found
indeed fome Intervals of Reflection, and theferiou?
Thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return a-
gain fometimes, but I (hook them off, and rouz'd
my felf from them as it were from a Diftemper,
and applying my felf to Drinking and Company,
foon mafter a the Return of thofe Fits, for fo I
call'd them, and I had in five or fix Days got as
compleat a Vi&ory over Confcience as any young
Fellow that refolv'd not to be troubl'd with i^
could defire : But I was to have another Trial forit
(till ; and Providence, as in fuch Cafes generally
it does, refolv'd to leave me entirely without Ex-
cufe. For if I would not take this for a Delive-
rance, the next was to be fuch a one as the worft
and moil harden'd Wretch among us would con-
Ms both the Danger and the Mercy.

[ 10]

The fixthBavof our being at Sea we came in*
XoXammtb Roads ; the Wind having been contra-i
iy, and the Weather calm, we had made but little
Way fince the Storm. Here we were obliged to
come to an Anchor, and here we lay, the Wind con-
tinuing contrary, viz,, at South-weft, for feven or
eight Days, during which time a great many Ships
from Nev^aftlc came into the fame Roads, as the
Common Harbour where the Ships might wait for
a Wind for the River.

We had not however rid here fo long, but fhoul4
Jiave Tided it up the River, but that the Wind
fclew too frefh ,• and after we had Iain four or five
-Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads be-
ing reckoned as good as a Harbour, the Anchorage

od, and our Ground-Tackle very ftrong, our

Len were unconcerned, and not in the leaft appre-?
hcnfive of Danger, but fpent the Time in Reit and
Mirth, after the manner of the Sea; but the eighth
Day in the Morning, the Wind increafed, and we
had all Hands at Work to ftrike our Top-Mails,
and make every thing fnug and clofe^ that the Ship
might ride as eafy as pofible. By Noon the Sea
went very high indeed, • and our Ship rid Forecaftle
in, (hipp d fevcral Seas, and we thought once or
twice our Anchor had come home; upon which
our Mailer order 'd out the Sheet Anchor; fo that
we rode with two Anchors a-head, and the Cables
vered out to the better End.

By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed,
and now I began to fee Terror and Amazement in
the Faces even of the Seamen themfelves. The Ma-
iler, tho' vigilant in the Bufinefs of preferving the
Ship, yet as he went in and out of his Cabbin by
me, I could hear him foftly to himfclf fay feveral
times, Lord be. merciful to us, wejhall be all loft, 'tw
{baUbeaU undone ; and the like. During thefe firft

Hut-



ii •



■ •— "-



flurries, I was ftupid, lying ft ill In my Cabbin,
which was in the Steerage, dnd cannot deferi be my
Temper : I could ill re-aflume the firft Penitence,
which I had fo apparently trampled upon, and har-
flenM my felf againft : I thought the Bittetaefs of
Death had been paft, and that this would be no-
thing too like thefirft. But when the Mafter hint-
felf came by me, as I faid juft now, and faid we
fliould be aU loft, I was dreadfully frighted • I got
up out of my Cabbin, and look'd out ; but fuch a
difmal Sight I never faw : The Sea went Mountains
high, and broke upon us every' three or four Mi-
nutes : When I could look about, I could fee no-
thing but Diftrefs round us : Two Ships that rid
near us, we found, had cut their Mafts by the
Board, being deep loaden ; and our Meh cry'd out,
that a Ship which rid about a Mifea-Head of us
was foundered. Two more Ships being driven from
their Anchors, were run out of the Roads to Sea,
at all Advenrqres, and that with hot a Maft (land-
ing. The light Ships fared the beft, as notfo much
labouring in the Sea ,• but two or three of them
drove, and came clofe by us, running awaiy with
only their Sprit-fail out before the Wind:

Towards Evening the Mate and Boatfwain
begg'd the Mafter of our Ship to let them cut £-
way the Fore-maft, which he was very unwilling^ s
fo .- But the Boatfwain protefting to him, that if he"' fc -
did not, the Ship would founder, he confented ;
and when they had cut away the Fore-maft, the
Main-maft ftood fo loofe, and fliook the Ship fo
much, they were obliged to cut her away alfo, arid
make a clear Deck.

Any one may judge what a Condition I muft be
in at all this, who was but a young Sailor, and
who had been in fuch a Fright before at but a lit-
tle. J0ut if I can exprefs at this Diftance the

Thoughts



t » ]

Thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in
* enfold more Hbrror of Mind upon Account of my
former Convi&ions, and the having returned from
them to the RefolutionsI had wickedly taken at firft,
than I was at Death it felf ; and thefe added to the
Terror of the Storm, put me into fuch a Condition,
tthat I can by no words defcribe it. But the worft
Was not come yet, the Storm continued with fuch
Fury, that the Seamen themfelves acknowledged
they had never known a worfe. We had a good Ship,
but the was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea,
that the Seamen every now and then cried out, fhe
would founder. It was my advantage in one refpeft,
that I did not know what they meant by Founder,
till I enquir'd. However, the Storm was fo vio-
lent, that I (aw what is not often feen, the Matter,
the Boatfwain* and fome others more fenfible than
the reft, at their Prayers, and cxpe&ing every Mo-
ment when the Ship would go to rhe Bottom. In
the Middle of the Night, and under all the reft of
of our Diftrgfles, one of the Men that had been
down on Purpofe to fee, cri?d out we had fprung a
Leak ; another faid there was four Foot Water in
the Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump.
At that very Word, ijiy Heart, as I thought, died
within me, and I fejl backwards upon the Side of
my Bed where I fat, into the Cabin. However,
the Men roufed me, and told me, that I that was
able to do nothing before, was as well able to
pump as another,* at which I ftirr'd up, and went
to the Pump and work'd very heartily. While this
was doing, the Mafter feeing fome light Colliers,
who not able to ride out the Siorm, were oblig'd
to flip and run away to Sea, and would come near
us, order'd to fire a Gun as a Signal of Diftrefs. I
who knew nothing what that meant, was fo furpri-
zed, that I thought the Ship had broke, or fome

dread-



tlj]



dreadful thing had happcn'd. In a word, I was fo
furprized, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this
was a time when every Body had his own Life to
think of, no Body minded me, or what was become
of me ; but another Man ftept up to the Pump, and
thrufting me afide with his Foot, let me lye, think-
ing I had been Dead ; and it was a great while
before I came to my felf.

We work'd on, but the Water encreafing in the
Hold, it was apparent that the Ship would founder,
and tho' the Storm began to abate a little, yet as
it was not poffible (he could fwim till we might run
into r a Port, fo the Matter continued firing Guns foe
Help ; and a light Ship who had rid it out juft a
Head of us, ventured a Boat out to help us- It was
with the utmoft hazard the Boat came near us, but
it was impoffible for us to get on Board, or for the
Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at laft the Men
rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to
fave ours, our Men caft them a Rope over the Stem
with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out a great
Length, which they after great Labour and Hazard
took hold of, and we hawl'd them clofe under out
Stern and got all into their Boat. It was to no
Purpofe for them or us after we were in the Boat to
think of reaching to their own Ship, fo all agreed
to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards
Shore as much as we could, and our Matter pro-
mifed them, That if the Boat was ftav'd upon
Shore he would make it good to their Mafter, fo
partly rowing and partly driving, our Boat wenta-
wayto the Northward, floaping towards the Shore
almoft as far as Winterton-Nefs,

We were not much more than a quarter of an
Hour out of our Ship but we law her fink, and
then I understood for the fir ft time what was meant
by a Ship foundering in the Sea ; I muft acknow-

kdgc I had hardly Eyes to look up when the §e*r
men told me fhe was finking; for from that Mo-
ment they rather put me into the Boat than that I
might be faid to go in, my Heart was as it were
dead within me, partly with Fright, partly with
Horror of Mind and the Thoughts of what war
yet hefore me*,

While we \fcrete in this Condition, the Meri yet!
labouring at the Oar to bring the Boat neat the
Shore, we could lee, when our Boat mounting the
JVcevesy toe ivere able to fee any 'thing,:*, great many.
People running along the Strand to aflUI us when:.
we fhould come near, but .we made but flow way.

Shore, tiU being paftthe.Light-Houfe zx.Winterton %
the Coaft falls off to the Weftward towards Cromer,
and To the Land broke off a little the Violence of
the Wind; Here we got in, and tho' not without;
much Difficulty got all fife on Shore, and walk'd
afterwards on Foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfhr^
runate : Men, we were ufed with great Humanity,
as well by the . Magiftratcs of the Town, who
afflgn'd us good Quarters, as by particular Mer-
chants and Owners of Ships, and had Money gi^
ven us fufficient to carry us either to London, or back
toHuSy as we thought fit.

Had I now had the Senfe to have gone back to
Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy*, and:
my Father, an Embleme of our blefled Saviour $ Pa-
rable, had even killed the fatted Calf for me $ tot
hearing the 'Ship I went away in, was caft away in
Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before he had
any Aflurancc that I was not drown'd.
' But my ill Fate pufh'd me on now with an Qb-
ftinacy that nothing could relift ; and tho* I had ie-
veral times loud Calls from my Reafon and my
more compofed Judgment to go home, yec J bad

ho Power to do it. I know not what to call this, not
will I urge, that it is a fecret over-ruling Decree
that hurries us on to be the Inftruments of our own
Deftru&ion, even tho' it be before us, and that we
pufli upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly no-
thing but fome fuch decreed unavoidable Mifery
attending, and which it was impofliblle for me to
efcape, could have pufli'd me forward againft the
calm Reafonings and Perfuafions of my moft re-
tired Thoughts, and againft two fuch vifible In-,
ftru&ionsas I had met with ifcmy firft Attempt. .

My Comrade, who had helped to harden me be-
fore, and who was the Matter s Son, wasnowlefs
forward than I ; the firft time he fpoke to me after
we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or
three Days, for we were feparated ia the Town
to feveral Quarters ; I fay, the firft time he (aw mc*
it appear'd his Tone was altcr'd, and looking very
melancholy, and (baking his Head, ask'd me how:
I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Trial, in order
to go farther abroad; his Father turning to me
with a very grave and concern'd Tone, Toung Mau %
fays he, you ought never to go to Sea am more, you ought
to take this for a plain and vifible Token that you are
not to be a Seafaring Man. Why, Sir, faid I, will you
go to Sea no more? "That is another Cafe, faid he,
it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you made
this Voyage for a Tryal,youfee what a Tafte Heaven has
given you of what you are to expeB if you perfiji ; perhaps
this is all- befallen us on your Account, like Jonah in the
ShipofTarfhifo. Pray, continues he, what are you ?
And in what Account did you go to Sea ? Upon that I
told him fome of my Story ; at the End of which he
burft out with a ftrange kind of Paffion, What had.
I done, fays he, that fuch an unhappy. Wretch fhould
come into my Ship; I would notfet my Foot; in

the



folvcd to go again ; and who taking a Fancy ta mf
Convocation, which was not at all difagreeable at
that time, hearing me fay I had a mind to fee the
World, told me, if I wou'd go the Voyage with
him I fhould be at no Expence ; I fhould be his
Mefs-mate and his Companion, and if I could car*
ry any Thing with me, I fhould have all the Ad-
vantage of it that the Trade would admit i and
perhaps I might meet with fome Encouragement.

I embraced the Offer, and entring into a firift
Friendfliip with this Captain, who was an honeft
and plain-dealing Man, I went the Voyage with
him, and carried a fmall Adventure with me, which
by the difinterefted Honefty of my Friend the Cap-
tain, I increafed very considerably ; for I carried a-
bout 40/. in fuch Toys and Trifles as the Captain
diit&ed me to buy- This 40 /. I had muftcred to-
gether by the Affiftance of fome of my Relations
whom I correfponded with, and who, I believe,
got my Father, or at leaft my Mother, to contri-
bute fa much as that to my firft Adventure.

This was the only Voyage which I may fay was
fucce&ful in all my Adventures, and which I owe to
the Integrity and Honefty of my Friend the Cap-*
tain, under whom alfo I got a competent Know-
ledge of the Mathematics and the Rules of Na-
vigation, karn'd how to keep an Account of the
Ship's Courfc, take an Obfervation ; and in (horr*
to underftand fome Things that were needful to be
undcrftood by a Sailor : For, as he took Delight to
introduce me, I took Delight to learn ; and, in a
Word, this Voyage made me both a Sailor and a
Merchant : For I brought Home £. 5. 9 Ounces of
Gold Duft for my Adventure, which yielded me in
London, at my Return, aim oft 300 /. and this fiU'd
me witjjU:hofe afpiring Thoughts which havcfince
(0 compieated my Ruin.

Yet



t *9 1 .

Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes
too ; particularly, that I was continually fick, be-
ing thrown into a violent Calenture by the exceffive
Heat of the Climate ; our principal Trading being
upon the Cbaft, from the Latitude of 15 Degrecsi
North even to the Line it fclf.

I was now fet up for a Guiney Trader ; and my
Friendi to my great Misfortune, dying foon after his
Arrival, I refolv'd to go the fame Voyage agaiiy
and I embark 'd in the fame Veffel with one whd was
his Mate in the former Voyage, and had noto got
the Command of the Ship. This was the unhap^
pieft Voyage that ever Man made ,• for tho' I did
not carry quite tool, of my new gain'd Wealth*
fo that I had 200/. left, and which I lodg'd with
my Friend's Widow, Who was very juft to me, yet
I fell into terrible Misfortunes in this Voyage; and
the firft was this, viz,. Our Ship making her Courft
towards the Canary Iflands, or rather between thofe
Iflands and the African Shore, was furprized in the
Grey of the Morning, by a lurkijh Rover olSallee}
-who gave Chafe to us with all the Sail flie could
make. We crowded alfo as much Canvafs as our
Yards would fpread, or our Mails carry, td have
got clear ; but finding the Pirate gain'd upon us^
and would certainly come up with us in a fe\tf
Hours, we prepar'd to fight ; our Ship having 1 2
Guns* and the Rogue 18. About three in the Af-
ternoon he came up with usj and bringing too by
Miftake, juft athwart our Quarter, inftead of a-
thwart our Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of
•dur Guns to bear on that Side, and pour'd in *
•Brtiadfide upon him, which made him iheer offa-
: gain, after returning our Fire, and pouring in alfd
.his faiall Shot from near 200 Men which he had oil
Jfoard., However, we had not a Man tctiBh'dj all
our Mm keeping clofe. He prepared tarrock fc$

agairt, and -we to defend our felves ; but laying us
on Board the next time upon our other Quarter,
he entered fixty Men upon our Decks, who imme-
diately fell to cutting and hacking the Decks and
Rigging. We ply'd them with SmalUhot, Half-
Pikes, Powderr Cherts, and fuch like, andclear'd
our Deck* of them twice* However, to cat fliort
this melancholy Part of our Story, our Ship being
difablcd, and three of bur Men kilTd, and eight
wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were car-
ry *d all Prifoners into Sallee, a Port belonging to
the Moors.

The Ufage I had there was not fo dreadful as at
firftl apprehended, nor was I carried up the Coun-
try to the Emperor 's Court, as the reft of our Men
were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover,
as his proper Prize, and made his Slave, being
young and nimble, and fit for his Bufinefs. At this
lurpri'zing Change of my Circumftances from a
Merchant to a miferable Slave, I was perfe&ly o-
ver whelmed ; and now I looked back upon my Fa-
thers prophetick Difcourfe to me, that I (hould be
miferable, and have none to relieve me, which I
thought was now focfte&ually brought to oafs, that
it could not be worfe; that now the Hand of Hea-
ven had overtaken me, and- 1 was undone without
Redemption. But alafs ! this was but a Tafle of
the Mifery I was to go thro', as will appear in the
Sequel of this Story.

As my new Patron or Matter had taken me Home
to his Houfe, fo I was in Hopes that he would take
me with him when he went to Sea again, believ-
ing thar it would fome time or other be his Fate
to be taken by a Spanijh or Portugal Man of War ;
and that then I (hould be fet at Liberty- But rhis
Hope j^minc, was foon taken away ; for when he
frent to Sea, he left me on Shore to look after his
■"■'.' little



little Garden, and do the common jDrudgery of
SUv.es about his Houfe ,• and when he came Home
again from his Cruife, he ordered me to lie in the
Cabin to look after the Ship.

Here I meditated nothing but my Efcape ; and
what Method I might take to effed it, but found
no Way that had the leaft Probability in it : No-
thing prefented to make the Suppofition of it ra-
tional ; for I had no Body to communicate it to,
that would embark with me ; no Fellow-Slave, no
Englffi Man, Irijb Man, or Scotch Man there but my
felf ; fo that for two Years, tho f I often pleafed my
felf with the Imagination, yet I never had the leaft
encouraging Proipeft of putting it in Practice.

After about two Years, an odd Circumftance
prefented it felf, which put the old Thought of
making fome Atttempt for my Liberty, again in
my Head : My Patron lying at Home longer than
ufual, without fitting out his Ship, which, as I
heard, was for want of Money ; he ufed conftant*
ly, once or twice a Week, fometimes oftner, if the
Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace, and
go out into the Road a fifhing ; and as he always
took me and a young Marefco with him to row the
Boat, we made him very^ merry, and I prov'd very
dpxterous in catching Filh; infomuch that fome-
times he would fend me with a Moor, one of his
Kinfmen, and the Youth the Marefco, as they call'd
him, to catch a Difh of Fifii for him.

It happen'd one time, that going a fifhing in a
ftark calm Morning, a Fog rofe Co thick, that tho*
we were not half a League from the Shore we loft
Sight of it ; and rowing we knew not whither or
which Way, we labour d all Day and all the next
Night, and when the Morning came we found we -
had pull'd off to Sea inftead of pulling in for the
Shore ; and that we were at leaft two Leigucsfrom

C 3 the



[ ** ]

{he Shore : However, we got well in again, tho*
with a great deal of Labour, and fome Danger ;
for the Wind began to blow pretty frefh in the
^lorning ; but particularly we were all very hungry.

But our Patron, warnM by this Difafter, rcfolved
:o take more Care of himfelf for the future ; and
liaving lying by him the Long-Boat of our Englijb
$hip they had taken, he refolved he would not go
a fifliing any more without a Comp^fs and fome
Provifipn ; fo he ordered the Carpenter of his
{Ship, who alfp was an Englijh Slave, to build a lit-
tle State-Room or Cabin in the middle of the
Long-Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place tq
ftand behind it to fleer and hale home the Main-
fheet ; and Room before for a Hand or two to.
ftand and work the Sails ? She failed with that we
fall a Snoblder of Mutton Sail ; ^nd the Boom
aib'd ov^f the Top of the Cabin, which lay very
plug jind low, and had in it Room for him to lie^
with a Slave or two, find a Table to eat on, with
lbme finall Lockers to put in fome Bottles of fucfy
Liquor as he thought fit to drink ; particularly
his Bre^d, Rice and Coffee.

We went frequently out with this Boat a fifliing,
nd as I w^s moft dextrous to catch Fifli for him*
ie never went without m? : It happened that he
Jiad appointed to go out in this Boat, either for
Pleafure pr for Fifh, with two or three Moors of
jjome Diftin&ion in that Place, and for whom he
had provided extraprdinarily ; and had therefore
fent on Board the Boat over Night, a larger Stpre
of Provifions than ordinary ; and had order'd me
to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot*
which were on Board his Ship ; for that they de-
fign*d fome Sport of Fowling as well as Fifliing.

I got ail Things ready as he had di reded, and

waited the next Morning with the Boat, wafhed

dean, her Antient and Pendants out, and every
thing to accommodate his Guefts ; when by ana
by my Patron came on Board alone, and told me
his Guefts had put off going, upon fome Bufinefs
that fell out, and order d me with the Man and
Boy, as ufual, to go out with the Boat and catch
them fome Fifli, For that his Friends were to fup
at his Houfe ; and commanded that as foon as I
had got fome Fifh I fiiould bring it home to his
Houfe > all which I prepaid to do.

This Moment my former Notions of Deliver*
ance darted into my Thoughts, for now I found I
was like to have a little Ship at my Command ; and
my Matter being gone, I prepared to furnifli my
felf, not for a fifiiing Bufinefs, but for a Voyage ;
tho' I knew not, neither did Ifo much as confider
whither I fliould fleer ; for any where £p get out
pf that Place was my Way.

My firft Contrivance was to make a Pretence to
fpeak to this Moor, to get fomething for our Sulr
fiftence on Board ; for I told him we muft not pre-
sume to eat of our Patron's Bread; he faid, that
was true ; fo he brought a large Basket of Rusk
or Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with frefh
Water into the Boat ; I knew where my Patron's
Cafe of Bottles flood, which it was evident by
the Make were taken out of fome Englijh Prize ; and
I conveyed them into the Boat while the Moor was
on Shore, as if they had been there before, for our
Mafter : I conveyed alfo a great Lump of Becs-
Wax into the Boat, which weighed above half a
hundred Weight, with $ Parcel of Twine or
Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw, and a Hammer, all
which were of great tffe to us afterwards: efpe-
eially the Wax to make Candles/ Another Trick
I try'd upon him, which he innocently came inta

or Moeljy (o I calfd to him, Moely faid I, our Pa-
tron's Gtihs are on Board the Boat, can you not
get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may
kill feme Akamies (a Fowl like our Culieus) for our
felvxs, for I know he keeps the Gunner's Stores in
the Ship ? Yes, fays he, I'll bring fome, and ac-
cordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch which
held about a Pound and half of Powder, or rather
more ; and another with Shot, that had five or fix
Pound, with fome Bullets } and put all into the
Boat : At the fame time I had found fome Powder
of my Matter's in the great Cabin, with which I
fiil'd one of the large Bottles in the Cafe, which
was almoft empty ; pouring what was in it into a-
nother : And thus furniflied with every thing need-
ful, we faii'd out of the Port to fifli : The Cafile,
which is at the Entrance of the Porr, knew who we
were, and took no Notice of us ; and we were not
above a Mile out of the Port before we hal'd iri our
Sail, and fet us down to fifli : The Wind blew
from the N. NE. which was contrary to my Defire;
for had it blown Southerly, I had been fure to have 1
made the Coaft of Spain, and at leaft reach'd to the
Bay of Cadiz, ; but my Resolutions were, blow
which way it would, 1 would be gone from that
horrid Place whore I was, and leaves the reft to Fate.
After we had fifii'd fome time and catch 'd no-
thing, for when I had Fifh on my Hcok, I would
not pull them up, that he might not fee them ; I faid
to the Moor, this will not do, our Matter will not
be thus ferv'd, we mull: ftand farther off: He think-
ing no Harm agreed, and being in the Head of the
Boat fet the Sails ; and as I had the Helm I run
the Boat out near a League farther, and then
brought her too as if I would fifli, when giving
the Bby the Helm, 1 ftept forward to where the
Moor was, asd making as if I ftoop'd for fome-

thing behind him, I took him by furprize with
my Arm under his Twift, and toft him clear o-
ver board into the Sea ; he rife immediately, for
he fwam like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd to be
taken in, told me he would go all over the World
with me ; he fwam fo ftrong after the Boat that he
would have reach'd me very quickly, there being but
little Wind ; upon which I ftept into the Cabin*
and fetching one of the Fowling-pieces, I prefented
it at him, and told him, I had done him no hurt,
and if he would be quiet I would do him none : But
faid I, you fwim well enough to reach the
Shore, and the Sea is calm, make thebeft of your
Way to Shore and I will do you no harm, but if
you come near the Boat Til fhoot you thro* the
Head ; for I am refolved to have my Liberty ; fo
he turn'd himfelf about and fwam for the Shore,
and I make no doubt but he reach'd it with Eafe,
for he was an excellent Swimmer.

I could have been content to ha' taken this Moor
with me, andha'drown'dthe Boy, but there was no
venturing to truft him : When he was gofle I turn'd
to the Boy, who they call'd Xury y and faid to
him, Xury, if you will be faithful to me Til make
you a great Man, but if you will not ftroak your
Face to be true to me, tkatis,fwareby Mahomet and
his Father's Beard, I muft throw you into the Sea
too ; the Boy fmil'd in my Face and /poke fo inno-
cently that I could not miftruft him ; and fwore to
be faithful to me, and go all over the World with
me.

While I »was in View of the Moor that was
fwimming, I flood out dire&ly to Sea with the Boat,
rather ftretching to Windward, that they might
thirtk me gone to wards the Straits-mouth (as indeed
any one that had been in theirWits muft ha' been fup-
pos'dto do)forwho would ha'fuppoafd wc.werefailM

on to the Southward to the truly Barbarian Coaft*
where whole Nations of Negroes wercfure to fur-*
yonnd us with their Canoes, and deftroy us;
where we could ne'er once gone on Shore biit w$
Jhouid be devoured by favage Beads or more mer-
cilefs Savages of human kind.

But as toon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I
chang'd my Courfe, and fteer'd dire#ly South and
|>y Eaft, bending my Courfe a little toward th$
Eaft, that I might keep in with the Shore ; and
having a fair frefh Gale of Wind, and fmooth quiQ t
,, I made fuch Sail that I believe by the next
y at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when I
firft made the Land, I could not be k(s than 150
Miles South ofSallee; quite beyond the Emperor
of Morocco's Dominions, or indeed of any other
King thereabouts, for we faw no People.
/ Yet fuch was the Fright I had taken at the Mows %
and the dreadful Apprehenfions I had of falling inr
to their Hands, that I would notftop, or go on
Shore, or come to an Anchor ,• the Wind continu-
ing fair, 'till I had fail'd in that manner five Days : ;
And then the Wind fliifting to the Southward ; I
concluded alfo that i( any of our Veflels were in
Chafe of me, they alfo would now give over ,- fo
I ventured to make to the Coaft, and came to an
Anchor in the Mouth of a little River, I knew not
what, or where ; neither what Latitude, what
Country, what Nation, or what River: I neither
faw, or defir'd to fee any People, the principal thing
I wanted was frefh Water : We came into this
Creek in the Evening, refolving to fwim on Shore
asfoon as it was dark, and difcover the Country ;
but as foon as it was quite dark, we heard fuch
dreadful Noifes of the Barking, Roaring, and
Howling of wild Creatures of we knew not what
Kinds, that the poor Boy was ready to die with

Fe^r and begg'd of me not to go on Shore till
Day ; well Xbiry> faid I, then I won't, but it may
be we may fee Men by Day, who will be as bad to
us as thofe Lyons ; then we give them the float Gun,
fays Xury, laughing, make them run wcy; fuch Englifi
Xury fpoke by converting among us Slaves, howe-
ver I was glad to fee the Boy fo cheerful, and I
gave him a Dram (out of our Patron's Cafe of Bot-
tles) to chear him up : After all, Xury's Advice
was good, and I took it, we dropp'd our little An-
chor and lay ftill £il Night; I fay ftill, for we flept
none ; for in two or three Hours we faw vaft great
Creatures (we knew not what to call them) of
many forts, come down to the Sea^fhore and run in*
to the Water, wallowing and wafting themfelves
for the Pleafure of cooling themfelves : and they
made fuch hideous Howlings and Ycllings, that I
pever indeed heard the like.

Xury was dreadfully frighted, and indeed fo was
I too ; but we were both more frighted when we
heard one of thefe mighty Creatures come fwim-
jning towards our Boat, we could not fee him, bdt
we might hear him by his blowing to be a mon-
strous, huge and furious Beaft ; Xury faid it was a
Lyon, and it might be fo for ought I know,- but
poor Xury cried to me to. weight the Anchor and
row away; no, faid I, Xury, we can flip our Cable
with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they cannot
follow us far; I had no fooner faid fo, but I per-
Cciv'd the Creature (whatever it was) within two
Oars length, which fomething furprued me ; how-
ever I immediately ftept to the Cabin-door, and
taking up my Gun fir'd at him, upon which he im-
mediately turn'4 about and fwam towards the
Shore again.

But it is impoflible to defcribe the horrible Noi-
fes, and hidious Cries and Howlings, that were
1 • ratfed



raifed as well upon the Edge of the Shore, as high-
er within the Country ; ; upon the Noife or Re-
Soft of the Gup, a Thing I have Tome Reafon to
elievc thofe Creatures had never heard before :
This convinced me that there was no going on
Shore for us in the Night upon that Coaft, and
how to venture on Shore in the Day was another
Qiieftion too ; for to have fallen into the Hands
oiany of the Savages, had been as bad as to
have fallen into the Hands of Lyons and Ty-
gprs ; at leaft we were equally apprehend ve pf the
ganger of it.

Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on
Shore fomewherc or other for Water, for we had
not a Pint left in the Boat ; when or where to get to
it was the Point ; Xury faid, if I would let him go
pn Shore with one of the Jars, he would find it there
'Was ;any Water and bring fome to me. I ask'd
him why he would go ? Why I fliould not go and
he ftay in the Boat ? The Boy anfwer'd with fo
much Afte&ion, that made me love him ever
after. Says he, // wild Mans come» they eat we, you
go viey. Well, Xury 9 faid I, we will bpth go, and
if the wild Mans come, we will kill them, they
(hall cat neither pf us,- fo I gavx Xury a piece of
Rusk-bread to cat, an^ 3 Dram but of our Pa-
tron's Cafe of Bottles which I mentioned before ;
and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shore as we
thought was proper, and waded on Shore ; car-
rying nothing but our Arms, and two Jarrs for
YVater.

1 did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat,
fearing the coming of Canoes with Savages
down the River; Bat the Boy feeing a low Place
about a Mile up the Country raribled to it ; and
by and by I faw him come running towards me,
I thought he was purfucd by fome Ravage, or

frighted

frighted with fomc wild Beaft, and I run forward
toward him to help him, but when I came nearer
to him, I faw fomething hanging ever his Shoul-
ders which was a Creature that he had (hot, like a
Hare but different in Colour, and longer Legs,
however we were very glad of it, and it was very
good Meat ; but the great Joy that poor Xurj
came with, was to tell me he had found good Wa-
ter and feen no wild Mans.

But we found afterwards that we need not take
fuch Pains for Water, for a little higher up the
Creek where we. where, we found the Water frefli
when the Tide was out, which flowed but a little
way up; fo we rilled our Jarrs and feafted on the
Hare, we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, having feen no Foot-fteps of any human
Creature in that part of the Country.

As I had been one Voyage to this Coaft before,
I knew very well that the Iflands of the Canaries,
and the Cafe de Veird Iflands alfo, Jay not far off
from the Coaft. But as I had no Inftruments to
take an Obfervation to know what Latitude we
were in, and not exa&ly know, or at leaft to re-
member what Latitude they were in ; I knew not
where to look for them, or when to ftand off to Sea
towards them ; otherwife I might now eafily have
found fome of thefe Iflands. But my hopes was,
that if I flood along this Coaft till I came to that
Part where the Englijh traded, I ftouJd find fome o£
their Veflels upon their ufuai Defign of Trade,
that would relieve and take us in.

By the beft of my Calculation, that Place where
I now was, muft be that Country, which lying be-
tween the Emperor of Morocco's Dominions and the
Negroes, lies waft and uninhabited, except by wild
Beafts; the Negrces having abandoned it and gone
farther South for fear of the Moors ; and the Moors

not



hat thinking it worth inhabiting, By rcafon of its
Barrennefs ; and indeed both forfaking it becaufef
of the prodigious Numbers of Tygers, Lyons;
Leopards, and other furious Creatures which har-
bour there ,• fo that the Moors ufe it for their Hun-
ting only, where they go like an Array, two or three
thoufand Men at a Time ; and indeed for near an
hundred Miles together upon this Coaft, we (aw
nothing but a waft uninhabited Country, by Day ;
and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of
wild Beads, by Night.

' Once or twice in the Day time* I thought I faw
the Pico of Teneriffy being the high top of the
Mountain Teneriffein the Canaries ; and had a great
mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither;
but having tried twice I was forced in again, by
contrary Winds, thfe Sea alfo going too high for mjr
•little Veflel, fo I refolved to purfue my Am Defign
and keep along the Shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for frrfh Wa-
ter, after we had left this Place ; and once in par-
ticular, being early in the Morning, we came to
an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was
pretty high, and the Tide beginning to flow, we
lay ftill to go farther in ; Xury, whofe Eyes were
taore about him then it feems mine were, calls foft-
ly to me, and tells me that we had beft go farther
off the Shord; for* fays he, look yonder lies a
dreadful Monfler on the Side of that Hiliock faft
aflecp : I tookld? where he pointed, and faw a
dreadful Monfter indeed, for it wa^ a terrible great
Lyon that lay on the Side of the Shore, uftder the
Shade .of a Piece of the Hill that hung as it were a
little over him. Xury, faid I, youfhall go on Shore
and kill him; Xttry look'd frighted, and faid,
Me kill I he eat me at one Mouth; one Mouthful he
meant ; however* I faid no more to the Bt>y, but

bJld hinl lye ftill, and I took our biggeft Gun,
whicK was almoft Musket-bore, and loaded it with
a good Charge of Powder, and with rwo Slugs*
and laid it down > then I loaded another Gun with
two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pie-
ces, I loaded with five fmaller Bullets. I took the
beft Aim I could with the firft Piece to havp (hot
him into the Head, but he lay fo with his Leg
rais'd a little above his Nofe, that the Slugs hie
his Leg about the Knee, and broke the Bone. He
ftarted up growling at firft, but finding his Leg broke
fell down again, and then got up upon three Legs,
and gave the moft hideous Roar that ever I heard ;
I was a little furpriz'd that I had not hit him on
the Head > however I took up the fecond Piece im-
mediately, and tho* he began to move off fir'd a-
gain, and fhot him into the Head, and had the
Pleafure to fee him drop, and make but little Noife,
but lay ftruggling for Life. Then Xury took Heart,
and would have me let him go on Shore : Well, go
faid 1 1 fo the Boy jump'd into the Water, and ta-
king a little Gun in one Hand, fwam to Shore with
the other Hand,. and coming clofe to the Creature,
put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and (hot
him into the Head again, which difpatch'd him
quite.

This was Game indeed to us, but this was no
Food, and I was very forry to lofe three Charges of
Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good
lor nothing to us. However, Xury (aid, he would
have fome of him ; fo he comes on board, ask'd
me to give him the Hatchet ; for what> Xury 3 faid
I ? Me cut oft his Head, faid he. However, Xury
could not cut off his Head, but he cut off a Foot
and brought it with, him, and it was a monftrous
great one.

. J be-

1 bethought my felf however, that perhaps the
Skin of him might one way or other be of fome
Value to us ; and I refolved to take off his Skin if
I could. So Xury and I went to work with him ;
but Xury was much the better Workman at it, for I
*kncw very ill how to doit. Indeed it took us up
both the whole Day, but at laft we got off the
Hide of him, and fpreading it on the top of our
Cabin; the Sun effectually dried it in two Days
time, and it afterwards ferv'd me to lye upon.

After this Stop we made on to the Southward
continually for ten or twelve Days, living very
fparing on our Provifions, which be'gan to abate
very much, and going no oftner into the Shore than
we were oblig'd to for frefli Water ; my Defign in
this was to make the River Gambia or SenegaO, that
is to fay> any where about the Cafe de Verd y where
I was in hopes to meet with fome European Ship,
and if I did not, I knew not what Courfe I had
to take, but to feek for the I/landy tit perifli there
among the Negroes. I knew that 411 the Ships from
Europe, which iail'd either to tj*e Coaft oiGuiney*
or to Brafily or to the Eaftl/idies, made this Capei
or thofe I/lands ; and in a word, I put the whole
of my Fortune upon this (ingle Point, either that I
muft meet with fome Ship, ormuft perilh.

When I had purfued this Refolution about ten
Days longer, as I have faid, I began to fee that
the Land was inhabited, and in two or three
Places as we failed by, we faw People ftand upon
the Shore, to look at us, we could alfo perceive
they were quite Black and Stark-naked. I was once
inclined to have gone on Shore to them ; but Xury
was my better G>unfcllor f and (aid to me, no go,
K no go ; however I hawl'd in nearer the Shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they run along
the Shore by me a good way > I obferv'd they had

liO



C33]

nt Weapons in their Hands, except one who had a
long (lender Stick, which Xury faid was a Lance,
and that they would throw them a great way wtrh
good Aim; fo I kept at a diltance, but talk 'd with
them by Signs as well as I could ; and particularly
made Signs for fomething to eat, they beckon 'd to
me to ftop my Boat, and they would fetch mc
fome Meat; upon this I lower'd the top of my
Sail, and lay by, and two of them run up into the
Country, and in lefs than half an Hour came back,
and brought with them two Pieces of dry Flefh
and fome Corn, fuch as is the Produce of their
Country ; but we neither knew what the one or the
other was; however we were willing to accept it,
but how to come at it was our next D.Tpute, for I
was not for venturing on Shore to them, and they
were as much affraid of us ; but they took a fafe
way for us all, for they brought it to the Shore and
laid it down, and went flood a great way off
till we fetch'd it on Board, and then came clofe to
us again.

We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had
nothing to make them amends ; but an Opportuni-
ty offer'd that every Inftant to oblige them won-
derfully, for while we were lying by the Shore,
came two mighty Creatures, one purfuing the Other,
(as wetook it) with great Fury, horn the Mountains
rewards the Sea ; whetherit was the Malepurfiing
the Female,or whether they were in Sport or in Rage,
we could not tell, any more than we could tell whe-
ther it was ufual or ftrange, br.t I believe it was the
latter; becaufe in the firft Place, thofe ravenous
Creatures feldom appear but in the Night ; and in
the fecond Place, we found the People terribly
frighted, efpecially the Women. The Man that
had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them,
but the reft did ; however as the two Creatures

D ran



[34]

fan diredly into the Water, they did not fe?m to p£
tcr to fall upon any of the Negroes, but plung'd
thdmfelves into the Sea and fwam about as if
they had come for their Diverfion ; gt laft one of
them began to come nearer our Boat than at firil I
expe<3ed, but I Jay ready for him, for I had loaded
pay Gun with all poflible Expedition, ^nd t>ad Xury
load both the other j as foon as he came fairly with-
in my reach, I fir'd, and (hot him dire&ly into the
Head j immediately he funk down into the Water,
but rofe inftantly and plung'd up and down as if
he was ilruggling for Life ; and to indeed he was,
he immediately made to the Shore, but between
the Wound which was his rportal Hurt, and the
ftrangling of the Water, he dyed juft before he
reach'dthe Shore.

It is impoffible to exprefs the Afloniflinpent of
thefe poor Creatures at the Noife and the Fire of
my Gun ,* fome of them were $ven ready to dye
for Fear, and fell down as Dead with the very
Terror. But when they faw the Creature dead and
funk in the Water, and that I made Signs to them
to come to the Shore ; they took Heitt and came
to the Shore and began to fearch for the Creature,
I found him by his Blood itaiping the W^ter, and
by the help of a Rope which I flung rohnd him
and gave the Negroes to hawl, they drag'd him on
Shore, apd found that it was a moil curious Leo->
pard, fpotted and fine foan admirable Degree, and
the Negroes held up their H^nds with Admiration
to think what it was I h^d kill'd him with.

The other Creature frighted with the flalh of
Fire and the Noife of the Gun fwara on Shore,
and ran up directly to the Mpuntairjs from whence
{hey came, nor could I a; that Diflance know
what it was. I found quickly the Negroes were
for gating th$ Flefh pf this Creature, fp 1 yti§ wil-
ling



[35]

/ing to have them take it as a Favour from mo*
which when I made Signs to them that they might
take him, they wepc very thankful for, immediate"
\y they fell to work with him, and tho' they had no
jpaiife, yet with a fharpen'd piece of Wood they took
oft' his Skin as readily, and much more readily than
\ye cou'd have done with a Knife ; they offer 'd me
iome of the Flefh, which I declined, making as if
J would give it them, but made Signs for the Skin,
which they gave me very freely, and brought me a
great deal more of their Provifion, which tho' I did
not underftand, yet I accepted; then I made Signs
to them for fome Water, and held out one of my
Jarrs to them, turning it Bottom upward, to (hew
that it was empty, and that I wanted to have it
filled. They call'd immediately to fome of their
Friends, and there came two Women and brought
a great Veffel made of Earth, and burnt, as I fup-?
jpofe in the Sun ; this they fet down for me, as be-
fore, and I fent Xury on Shore with my Jarrs, and
filled them all three. Thp Women were as ftark
naked as the Men.

I was now furnifhed with Roots and Corn, fuch
as it was, and Water, and leaving my friendly Ne-
groes, I made forward for abput eleven Days more,
without offering to go near the Shore, till I faw
the Land run out a great Length into the Sea, at
about the Diftance of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm, I kept a large
offing to make this Point ; at length, doubling the
Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I
faw plainly Land on the other Side to Seaward ;
then I concluded, as it was moft certain indeed,
that this was the Cafe de Verdj and thofe the /•
/lands, calfd from thence Cafe de ferd Iflani^
However they were at a great Diftance, and I\
pould not well tell what I had'beft to do, 1 for if I

(hould be taken with a Frelh of Wind I might
neither reach one or other.

In this Dilcmna, as I was very penfive, I flept
into the Cabin, and fat me down, Xwry having
the Helm, when on a fudden the Boy cry ? d out
Mafter> Maftcr, a Ship v)hh a Sail, and the foolifh
Boy was frighted out of his Wits, thinking it
mult needs be fpme of his Mafter a s Ships (enfc to
purfue us, when, I kn^w we were gotten far enough
put of their reach. I jumped out of the Qfbin^
and immediately faw not only the Ship, but what
flic was, (viz.) that it was a Portugufe Ship, and
as I thought was bound to the Ccaft of Guinea for
Negroes. But when I obferv'd the Courfe (he
llectM, I was foon convinced they were bound
ibme other way, and did not defigh to come any
nearer to the Shore ; upon which I ftretch'd out to
£ea as much as I could, refolving to fpeak with
them if ppffible,

' With all the Sail I could make I found I fhould
not be able to come in their Way, but that they
(hould be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them ; but after I had crowded to the utmoft,
and began to defpair, they it feems faw me by the
help or their Perfpeftive-Glafles, and that it was
ibme European Boat, which as they fuppofed muft
belong to ibme Ship that was loft, fo they fhprt-
ned Sail to let me come up. I was encouraged
with this, and as I had my Patron *s Antient on
Board, I made a Waft of it to them for 3, Signal
of Diftrefs, and fir'da Gun, bpth which they few,
for they told me they faw the Smoke, tho* they did
not hear the Gun ; upon thefe Signals they very
kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in a-
^out three Hours time I cam6 up with them.

They ask'd me what I was, in Portuguefe, and in
SPW'A yid in French, but I underftood; none of

them »

theni ; but a laft a Scots Sailor who was on board}
cail'dto me, and I anfwer'd him, and told him I
was an Englijb Man, that I had made my efcapc out
of Slavery from the Moors at Sallee ; then they bad
me come on board, and very kindly took me in*
and all my Goods.

It was an inexpreffible Joy to me, that any on*
will believe, that I was thus deliver'd, as I efteem'd
it, from fuch a miferable and almoft hopelefs Con-r
dition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I
had to the Captain of the Ship, as a Return for
my Deliverance ; but he generoufly told me, he
torould take nothing from me, but that all I had
fliould be delivered fafe to me when I came to the
Brafihy for, fays he; I have fav'd your Life on no 0-*
theyTerms than I would be glad to befaved myfelf, and
it may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the
fame Condition ; befides, faid he, when I carry you to
the Brafils, fo great a way from your own Country, if I
fhould take from you what you have, you wiD be flawed
there, and then I only take away that Life I have givem
No, no, Seignior, Inglefe, fays he, Mr. Englifhman*
J will carry you thither in Charity, andthofe things witt
help you to buy your Subfiftance there, and yourPaffagi
home again.

As he was Charitable in his Propofal, fo he was
juft in the Performance to a tittle* for he ordered
the Seamen, that none fhould offer to touch any
thing I had ,• then he took every thing into his own.
Poffeffionj and gave me back an exaft Inventory of
them, that I might have them, eveh fo much as
my three Earthen Jarrs. .

As to my Boat it was a very good one* and
that he faw, and told me he would buy it of met
for the Ship's Ufe, and ask'd me what 1 would have
for it ? I told him he had been fo generous to me
ia every thing, that I could not ofter to make a-

. hy Pricte of the Boat, but left it entirely to hixnj
upon which he told me he would give me a Note
of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces of Eight for it
at Brafily and when it came there, if any one ojh
fer'd to give more he would make it up ; he offered
me alfo 60 Pieces of Eight more for my Boy Xury±
which I was loath to take, not that I was not wil-
ling to let the Captain have him, but I was very
loath to fell the poor Boy's Liberty, who had affi-
fted me fo faithfully in procuring my own. How-
ever when I let him know my Reafon, he ownM it
to be juft, and oflfer'd me this Medium, that he
would give the Boy an Obligation to fet him free
in ten Years, if he turn'd Chriftian ; upon this*
and Xury faying he was willing to go to him, I
let the Captain have him.

We had a very good Voyage to the BraJUs, and
arriv'd in the B<qr de Todos los Santos, or Ali-Saints-
Bayi in about 22 Days after. And now I was
Once more delivered from the moft miferable of
all Conditions of Life, and what to do next with
my fe!f, I was now to confider.

The generous Treatment the Captain gave me,
1 can never enough remember; he would take no-
thing of me for my Paflage, ga*e me 20 Ducats
fof the Leopard's Skin, and 40 tor the Lyon's Skin
which I had in my Boat, and caufed every Thing
I had in the Ship to be punctually delivered me,
and what I was willing to fell he bought, fuch as
the Cafe of Bottles, two of my Guns* and a Piece
of the Lump of Bees-wax, for, I had made Can-
dles of the reft ; in a word, I made about 220
Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo, and with this
Stock I went on Shore in the Brafilo.

I had not been long here, but being recommen-
ded to the Houfe of a good honeft Man like him-
Jelf, who had an Imeino as they call it; that is } a

. . Plan-



Plantation, and a Sugar-Houfe. I liv d with hirii
fomc Time, and acquainted myfelf by that Means
with the Manner of their planting and making of
Sugar; and feeing how well the Planters liv'd, and
how they grew rich fuddenly, I refolv'd, if I could
get Licence, to fettle there, I would turn Planter a-
mong them, revolving in the mean time to find out
fome way to get my Money, which I left in London,
remitted to me. To this Purpofe, getting a kind
of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchafed as much
Land that was uncur'd, as my Money would reach*
and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and Settlement,
and fuch a one as might be fuitable to the Stock*
which I proposed to myfelf to receive from England.

I had a Neighbour, a Portuguefe of Lisbon, but
born of Englijh Parents, whofe Name was WeUs*
and in much fuch Circumftances as I was; I call
him my Neighbour, becaufe his Plantation lay next
to mine, and we went on very fociably together. My
Stock was but low as well as his ; and toe rather
planted for Food than ahy Thing elfe, for about two
Tears. However, we began t<J encreafe, and our
Land began to come into Order ; fo that the third
Year we planted fome Tobacco, and made each of
us a large Piece of Ground ready for planting; Canes
in the Tear to come ; but we both wanted Help ;
and now I (bund more than before, I had done
ttrrong in parting With my Boy Story.

But alai ! for me to do wrong that never did right,
ttras no great Wonder : I had no Remedy but to
go on ; I was gotten into an Imployment quite re-
mote to my Genius, inddire&ly contrary to the Lift
1 delighted in, and for which I forfook my Father's
Houfe, and broke thro' all his good Advice ; nay*
I was coming into the very middle Station, or up-
per Degree of Idtf Life, which my Father Advifed
itie to Defore; and which* if I rcfolv'd to go od

D 4 With



[ 40 ]

with, I might as well ha* (laid at Home, andnevef
have fatigu'd my felf in the World as I had done ;
and I ufed often to fay to my felf, I could ha'
done this as well in England among my Friends, as
ha' gone jooo Miles oft to do it among Strangers
and Savages in a Wildernefs, and at fuch a Diftance,
as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the leaft Knowledge of me.
. In this manner I ufed to look upon my Condition
with the utmoft Regret. 1 had no Body to con-
vene with, but now and then this Neighbour ; no
Work to be done, but by the Labour of my Hands ;
and I ufed to fay, I liv'd juft like a Man call away
upon fomedefolatelfland, that had no Body there
but himfelf. But how juft lias it been, and how fhould
all Men refledt, that, when they compare their pre-
sent Conditions with others that arc worfe, Heaven
may oblige them to make the Exchange, and be
convine'd of their former Felicity, by their Experi-
ence : Hay, how juft has it been, that the truly foli-
tary Life I refle&ed on in an IQand of meer Defol-
tion ftiould be my Lot, who had fo often unjuftly
compar'd it with the Life which I then led, in which
had I continued, I had in all Probability been ex*
ceeding profperous and rich.

I was in fome Degree fettled in my Meafures for
carrying on the Plantation, before my kind Friend
the Captain of the Ship, that took me up at Sea*
went back ; for the Ship remained there in provi-
ding his Loading, and preparing for his Voyage*
near three Months, when telling him what little
Stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me
this friendlyand lincere Advice>SeignorIngIefe y fays he,
■for fo he always called me,if y ou will give meLetters,
and a Procuration here in Form to me, with Order*

tc&) and in fuch Goods as are prbper for thift
Country, I will bring you the Produce of them,
God willing, at my Return ; but fincc human Af-
fairs are all futjc£t to Changes and Difafters, I
would have you give Orders but for joo /. Sterl.
which you fay is half your Stock, and let the Ha*
zardberunfor the firit; fo that if it come fafc,
you may order the reft the fame Way ; and if it
mifcarry, you may have the other Half to have
Recourfe to for your Supply.

This was fo whclcfome Advice, and look'd fo
friendly, that I could not but be convine'd it was
the beft Courfe I could take > fo I accordingly pre-
pared Letters to the Gentlewoman, with whom I
had left my Money, and a Procuration to he Por-
tuguese Captain, as he delir'd*

1 wrote the Englijb Captain'sWidowafuIl Acconnt
of all my Adventures, my Slavery, Efcapc,and how
I had met with the Portugal Captain at Sea, the Hu-
manity of hisBehaviour, and in what Condition I was
now in, with all other necefl'ary Dire&ions for my
Supply ; and when this honeft Captain came to£&-
bon, he found mean> by fomeof the £«g/^I5Merchants
there, to fend over not the Order only, but a full
Account of my Story to a Merchant at London,
who reprefented it efre&ually to her j whereupon*
(he not only delivered the Money, but out of her
own Pocket fent the Portugal Captain a very hand-
fome Prcfent for his Humanity and Charity to m&
The Merchant in London veiling this ioo /. in
Englijb Goods, fuch as the Captain had writ for,
fent them dire&ly to him at Lisbon, and he brought
them all fafe to me to the Brafih, among which,
without my Direftion ( for I was too young in
my Bufinefs to think of them) he had taken Care
to have all fcrtsof Tool*> Iron- Work, and tJten-

' fib



[ 4* ]

ills, heceflary for my Plantation, and which were oi
great Ufe ttf me.

• When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortune
made, for I was lurprized with Joy of it ; and my
good Steward the Captain had laid out the five
Founds which my Friend had fent him for a Pre-
fent for himfclf, to purchafe, and bring me over a
Servant under Bond for fix Years Service, and would
sot accept of any Consideration, except a little
Tobacco* which I would have him accept, being
of my own Produce.

Neither was this all ; but my Goods being all
Englijh Manufactures, fuch as Cloath, Stuffs, Bays,
and Things particularly valuable and defirable in
the Country, I found Means to fell them to a very
great Advantage ; fo that I may fay, I had more
than four times the Value of my firft Cargo, and
was now infinitly beyond my poor Neighbour, I
mean in the Advancement of my Plantation ; for the
Jirft thing I did, I bought me a Negroe Slave, and an
European Servant alfo ; I mean another befides that
which the Captain brought me from Lisbon.

But as abus'd Profperity is oftentimes made the
very Means of our greateft Adverfity, fo was it with
me. I went on the next Year with great Succefs in
my Plantation : I raifed fifty great Rolls of Tobac-
co on my own Ground, more than I had difpofed
of for Neceffaries among my Neighbours; and
thefe fifty Rolls being each of above a ioo Wt. were
well cur'd and laid by againft the Return ; of the
Fleet from Lisbon : And now increafing in Bufinefs
and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of Pro-
je&s and Undertakings beyond my Reach ; fuch as
are indeed often the Ruin of the beft Heads in
Btifir.efs.

Had



Had t continued in thq Station t was now in, l
had room for all the happy Things to have yet be-
fallen me, for which my Father fo eameftly recom-
mended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had
fofeniibly defcribed the middle Station of Life to
be full off; but other Things, attended me, and I
was ftill to be the wilfukAgent of all my own
Miferies ; and particularly to encreafe my Fault,
and double the Refle&ions upon my felf,. which io
my future Sorrows I fhould havfc Iieifure to make i
ail thefe Mifcarriages were procured by my appa-
rent obftinate adhering to my foolifli Inclination, of
wandring Abroad, and purfuing that Inclination, in
Contradi&ion to the eleareft Views of doing my
felf good* in a fair and plain Purftrit of thoic Prop
peds, and thofe Meafures of Life, which Nature:
and Providence concurred to prefent mc with, and
to make my Duty.

As I had once done thus in my breaking away
from my Parents, fo I could not be content now,
but I muft go and leave the happy View t had o£
being a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantati-
on, only to purfue a rafh and immoderate Defire o£

ted ; and thus I caft my felf down again into the
deepeft Gulph of human Mifery rhat ever Man fell
into, or perhaps could be confident with Life and
a State of Health in the World. ., .

To come then by juft Degrees, to the Parti-
culars of this Part of my Story ; you may fuppofe*
that having now lived almoft four Years in the
Brafilo, and beginning to thrite and profper very
well upon my Plantation; I had not only learn'd
the Language, but had con traded Acquaintance
and Friendfhip among my Fellow-Planters, as well
as among the Merchants at St. Salvadore, which
w$s our Port > and that in my Difcourfes among:

them.



i



t443

Ihcm, T had frequently given them an Account ot
my two Voyages to the Coaft of Guinea, thd
manner of Trading with the Negroes there, and
how eafy it was to purchafe upon the Coaft, for
Trifles, fuch as Beads, Toys, Knives, Sciffarsi
Hatchets, Bits of Glafs, and the like ; not only
Gold Duft, Guinea Grains, Elephants Teeth* &c>
but Negroes for the Service of the Brafils, in great
Numbers.

They liftened always very attentively to my
Difcourfes on thefe Heads, but efpeciaUy to that
Part which related to the buying Negroes, which
wasm Trade at that Time not only cdt far entred
into, but as far as it was, had been carry 'd on by
the Afliento's, or Permiffion of the Kings of Spain
and Portugal, and engrofs'd in the Publick, fo that
few Negrces were brought, and thofe exceffive
dear.

It happen 'ds being in Company with fome Mer-
chants and Planters of my Acquaintance, and
talking of thofe Things very earneiHy, three of
them came to me the next Morning, and told me
they had been mufing very much upon what 1 had
difcourfed with them of, the laft Night, and they
came to make a fecret Propofal to me ; and after
enjoining me Secrecy, they told me, that they had
a mind to fit out a Ship to go to Guinea, that
they had all Plantations as well as I, and were
ftraiten'd for nothing fo much as Servants ; that as
it was a Trade that could not be carry 'd on, bc-
caufe they could not publickly fell the Negroes
when they came Home, fo they defir'd to
make but one Voyage, to bring the Negroes on
Shore privately, and divide them among their
own Plantations ; and in a word, the Queftion
was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the
Ship to manage the Trading Part upon the Coaft



[45]

pf Guiney ? And they offcr'd me that I (honld have
my equal Share of the Negroes^ without providing
any Part of the Stock.

This was a fair Propofal, it muft b$ confefs'd,
had it beep made to any one that had not had a
Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair Way of toming to be very
confiderable, and with a good Stock upon it. But
for me that was thus entered and eftabii&ed, an4
had nothing to do but go on as I had begun for
three or four Years more, and to have fent for the
other hundred Pound from England, and who in
that time, and with that little Addition, could
fcarce ha' fail'd of being worth three or four thou-
sand Pounds Sterling, and that encreafing too ,• for
me to think of fuch a Voyage, was themoft pre-r
pofterous Thing that ever Man in fuch Circum-
ftances could be guilty of.

But I that was born to be my own Deftroyer,
could no more refift the Offer than I could reftraini
my firft rambling Defigns, when my Father's good
Counfel was loft upon me. In a word, I told them
I would go with all my Heart, if they would un-
dertake to look after my Plantation in my Ab-
fence, and would difpofe of it to fuch as I fhould
direft, if I mifcarry'd. This they all engag'd to
do, and entred into Writings or Covenants to do
fo ; and I made a formal Will, difpofing of my
Plan ration and Eftedts, in Cafe ofmyDe.ath, ma-
king the Captain of the Ship that had fav'dmy Life,
as before, my univerfal Heir, but obliging him to
difpofe of my Eftefts, as I had direfted in my Will,
one half of the Produce being to himfelf, and the
other to be fhipp'd to England.

In fhort, I took all poffible Caution to preferve
my Eftefts and keep up my Plantation ; had I u-
fed half as much Prudence to have look'd into my

own



[4<n

own Intqreft, ^pd .have made a Judgment of whj£
t ought to h^ve done, and not to have done, I haa
pertainly never gone away from Co profperous an
Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of a
thriving Circumftance, and gone upon a Voyage
to Sea, attended with all its common Hazards,- to
fay nothing of the Reafons I had to exped particu-
lar Misfortunes to my felf.

But I was hurry'd on, and obeyed blindly the
Piftates of my Fancy rather tl^an my Reafon ,- an4
accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Car-
go fujttifhed, antd all Things done as by Agree-
ment, by my Partners in the Voyage, I went on
Board in an evil Hour again, the firft o( September >
155P, being the fame E>ay eight Tear that I went
from my Father and Mother at Hull, in order to
a& the Rebel to th^ir Authority, and the Fool to
my own Intereft.

Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried
fix Guns, and fourteen Men, including the Matter,
his Boy, and my feif ; we had 0^1 Board no large
Cargo of Goods, except of fuch Toys as were fit
for our Trade with the Negroes, fuch as Beads^
bits of Glafs, Shells, and odd Trifles, Specially
little Looking-GlafTes, Knives, Scifl'ars, Hatchets,
and the like.

The fame Day I went on Board we fet fail,
fianding away to the Northward upon our own
Coaft, with Defign to ftretch over for the African
Coaft, when they came about 10 or 1 a Degrees of
Northern Latitude, which it feems was the man-
ner of their Courie in thofe Days. We had very
good Weather, only exceffive hot, all the way up-
on our own Coaft, till we came the Height of
Cape St. Augujlinoy from whence keeping farther oflf
at Sea we loll Sight of Land, and tteer'd as if we
was bound for the lile fe> na\id de Noronba, holding

our



C 47 3

fiat Courfe N. E.by N. and leaving thofe Ifies q&
the Eaft > in this Courfe we paft the Line in about
1 1 Days time, and werp by our laft Observation in
7 Degrees 22 ^4ip. Northern Latitude, when a vi-
olent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out of
our Knowledge ; it began from the South- Eaft*
came about to the North- Weft, and then fettled
into the North-Eaft, from whence it blew in fuch
£ terrible manner, that for x 2 Days together we
could do nothing but drive, and fcuddipg away
before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the
Fury ot the Winds dire&ed ; and during thefe 1 z
Days, I need not fay, that I expe&ed every Day
to be fw^llowed up, nor indeed did <my in the Ship
expedfc to fave their Lives.

In this Diftr^s, w* had, befides the Terror of
the Storm, one of our Men die of the Calenture,
and one Man and the Boy wafh'd over- board,- a-
bout the twelfth Day the Weather abating a little,
the Matter made an Obfervatiqn as well as he
could, and found that he was in about eleven De-
grees North Latitude, but that he was twenty two
Degrees of Longitude difference Weft from Cape &.
Auguftipo ; fo that he found be was gotten upon the
Co^ft of Guiana, or the North Part of Brafil, be-
yond the River Amines, toward that of the Ri-
ver Orocnoque, commonly call'd the Gre^t River, and
began to confult with me what Courfe he fhould
take, for the Ship w^s le*ky antf very much difa-
tyed, and he was going dire&ly back to the Coaft
pf BrafiL

I was pofitively againft that, and looking over
the Charts of the Sea- Coaft of America with him,
we concluded there was no inhabited Country for
us to have recourfe to, till we came within the Cir-
cle of the CarrMe-Iflands, and therefore refolvcd
{0 ftand away for Barbados, which by keeping off

at



un

at Sea, to ayoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph
of Mexico, we might eafily perform, as we hoped,
in about iy Days Sail; whereas we could not
poffibly make our Voyage to the Coaft of Africa,
without fome Affiftance, both to our Ship and
to our felves.

With this Defign we chang'd our Courfe, and
fteer'd away N. W. by IV. in order to reach fome
of our Englijb Wands, where I hoped for Relief;
but our Voyage was other wife determined, for
being in the Latitude of 12 Deg. 18 Min. a fe-
cond Storm came upon us, which carry'd us away
with the fame Impetuofity Weliward, and drove
us fo out of the very Way of. all humane Com-
merce, that had <Jur Lives been faved, as to
the Sea, we were rather in*Danger of being de-
vour'd by Savages than ever returning to pur own
Country.

In this Diftrefs, theWind blowing ftill very hard,
one of our Men early in the Morning, cry'd out,
Land; and we had no fooner run out of the Ca-
bin to look out, in hopes of feeing whereabouts
in the World we were ,• but the Ship ftruck upon
a Sand, and in a Moment fter Motion being fo
ftoppM, the Sea broke over her in fuch a manner,
that we expe&ed we fhould all have periih'd im-
mediately, and we were immediately driven into
clofe Quarters to fhelter us from the very Foam
and Sprye of the Sea.

It is not eafy for any one, who has not beet*:
in the like Condition, to defcribe or conceive the
Confternation of Men in fuch Circumftances ; we
knew nothing where we were, or upon xfrhat Land
it was we were driven, whether an Ifland, or the
Main ; whether inhabited, or not inhabited ,• and
as the Rage ot the Wind was ftill great, tho' ra-
ther lefs than at firft, we could not fo much as

hope



; C 49 3

k>pe to have the Ship hold many Minutes without
breaking in Pieces, unlefs the Winds by a kind o£
Miracle fhould turn immediately about* In a
word, we fat looking one upon another, and ex-
peding Death every Moment, and every Man a&-
ing accordingly, as preparing for another World |
for there was little or nothing more for us to do in
this : That which was our pre fen t Comfort, and all
the Comfort we had, was, That contrary to ouif
Expe&ation the Ship did not break yet, and that
the Matter raid* the Wind began to abate.

Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little
abate, yet the. Ship having thus ftruck upon the
Sand, and flicking too faft forus to expe&hcr get?
ting off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed*
and had nothing to d* but to think of faving our ,
Lives as well as we could; we had a Boat at oi*r
Stern, juft before the Storin, butihe-wasfirfiflav'ci
by dafhing agaibft the ShipV Rudder, and in the
next Place fhe broke away, ..and either funk or
was driven off to Sea ; fo there was no Hope from
her : We had another Boa£ on Board, but how to
get her off into the Sea, was a doubtful Thing ;
however, there was no room to debate, for w6
fancy *d the Ship would break in Pieces every Mr
nute ; and fome told us (he was a&ually broken alf
ready.

In this Difireis, the Mate of our Verfel lays hold
of the Boat, and with the Help of the reft of the
Men, they got her flung over the ShipVfide, and
getting all into her, let go, and committed out
felves, being Eleven in Number, to God's Mercy*'
and the Irild Sea ; for tho' thle Storm was abated
coufiderably, yet the Sea went dreadful highuport
the Shore, and might well be calfd, Den wild Zei $
as the Dutch call the Sea in a Storm*

£ And



: And now our Cafe was very difmal indeed ; fot
we all few plainly, that the Sea went fo high, that
the Boat could not live, a?nd that we ftouldbe ine-
vitably drown'd. As to making Sail, we had none,
iTbr, ifwe had, could we have donc'any thing with
it; fo we work'd at the Oar toward* the Land,
thxf with heavy Heart*, -!fke Men going to Executi-*-
On ; for we all krfew, that when the Boat came nea-
rer the Shore, flie ^oiild be daQi'd in a thousand
Pieces by the Breach- of the. Sea. However we
committed our Souls to- God ir* the moft eameft
xhahnet, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore,
we haften'd our Definition with oujr owtr Hands,
puBinjgaJs-wellas'We'could towards Land.
"'What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand,
whether Steep or Shoal; W^knew n6t ,- the only
Hope that could ratiohalfy'give us the leaft Shadow
dPE3tpeaatioii,was-,if we. might happerr into fome
BayotGulph, or the Mouth of fome River, where
by great Chance We might have run our Boat in, or
gbt Under the Lee of the Land* and perhaps made
ftiooth Water. But there was nothing of this ap-
peiredjbut as We made hearer and nearer the Shore,
tfis Laridlook'd mbrfc frightful than the Sea.
"" After we had rewy-, or rather driven about a
Leagttc and a Half-, as we reckon 'd it, a raging
Wave, Mountain-like, came fowling a-ftern of us,
and plainly bad us expeft the C<tup-de-Grace. In a
word, it took us with fnch a Fury, that it overfet
• the Boat at once ; and feparating us as well from
the Boat, as from one another, gave us not Time
hardly to fay, O God ! for we are all fwallowed
ufr in a Moment.

- Nothing can defcribe the Confufion of Thought
which I fc.t when I funk into the Water ; for tho* I
fwam very well, yet I could not deliver myfelf from
the Waves, fo as to draw Breath, 'till the Wave

covered again with Water a good while, but not
fo long but I held it out; and finding the Water

Moments to recover Breath, and 'till the Water
went from me, and then took to my Heels,and run,
with what Strength I had, farther towards the
Shore: rjiit neither would this deliver me from
the Fury of the Sea, which came pouring in af-
ter me again, and twice more I was lifted up by
the Waves, and carry 'd forwards as before, the
Shore being very flat.

The laft Time of thefe two had well near been
fatal to me; for the Sea having hurry M me along as
before, landed me, or rather dafh'd me againft a
Piece of a Rock ; and that with fuch Force, as it
left me fenfelcfs, and indeed helpjefs, as to my own
Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and
Brcaft, beat the Breath, as it were, quite out of my
Body, arid had it returned again immediately, I
muft have been firangled in the Water; but I re-
cover'd a little before the Return of the Waves ;
and! feeing I flbould be cover d again with .the Wa-
ter, I refolv'd to hold Jfaft by a Piece of the Rock,
and fo to hold my Breach, i£ poflibjie, 'till the Wave
went back; noV as the Ws&c$ were not fo high as
at firft, being near Land, I held my Hold 'till the
Wave abated, and then fctch'd. another Run,
whidi brought me fo near th$ Shore, that the
next Wave^ tho* it went over me,, yet did not fo
fwaflow me up as to carry m$ away, and the next
Run I took, I got to the main Land, where, to
my great Comfort,-! clamber'd up the Gifts of
the Shore, and fat me down upon the Grafc* free
frojn Danger, and quite out of the Reach of the
Water.

I was now landed, andfafeon Shore, and began
to look up and thank God that my Life was fav'din
a Cafe wherein there was fomeMinutes before fcarce
any room to hope. I believe it is impoffible to ex-
prefs to the Life what the Extafies and Tranfport s of

the



the Sdul ate, when it is fo fav'd, as I.my fay, out
of thfe very Grave; and I do not wonder now at
that Cuftori, viz,. That when a Malefa&'cr, who
has the Halter abbut his Neck, is ty'd up, and juft
going tobetutn'doff, and has a Reprieve bt ought
to hint: I fay, I do not wonder that they bring 9
Surgeon with it, to let him Blood that very Mo-
ment they tell him of it, that the Surprize may not
drive the Animal Spirits from the Heart, and over-
whelm him:

* *

For fudden Joy j, - like Griefs, confound at firft.

I walkM about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands
and my whole Being, as I may fay, wrapt op in the
Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a thou-
fand Geiturcs and Motions which I cannot defcribe,
reflefting upon all my Comrades that were drown'd,
and that there fhould not be one Soul fav'd but my
(elf ; for, as for them, Ineverfaw them afterwards,
or ariy Sign of them, except three of their Hats,
one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.

I cad my Eyes to the ftranded Veffel, when the
Breach and Froth of the Sea being fo big, I could
hardly fee it* it lay fo far off, and confiaer'd, Lord !
how wis it poflible I could get on Shore !

After I had folac'd my Mind withthe comfortable
Part of my Condition, Ibegan to look round me to
fee what kind of Place I was in, and what was next
to be done, and I fpon found my Comforts abate ;
and that, in a word, F had a dreadful Deliverance :
For I was wet, had no Cloaths to fliift me, nor any
thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither
did I fee any Profpeft before nle, but that of pe-
ri flung with Hunger, or b^ing devour'cl by wild
Beafts; and that which was particularly afflicting
to me, was, that I had no Weapon either to hunt

E 3 and



[54]

and kjllany Cfcatqre for my^ufenaace, ,o£.<to de-
fend my lelfagainii -any other Creatutethat might
dehxe 10 kill me for their's : In a word, I had no-
thing about me but a.Knjfe a Tobacco-pipe, and
Wlutje Tobacco in a Bp?t.i;yhis.was all my Proyifi-
oni„V?4 "I* 15 threw , me. into .tejrjble pontes of
M if - j that !i »■' a while I- run abai*t }ike a M ad*jnanj '
Mjght coming -upon me,..J bqgan with * heavy
JSeirt-to toriuder what would be my L'otif there
were any ravenous Beafts in that Country, feeing
at Night they always come abroad for their Prey.
All the- Remedy tbatofier'd to my Thoughts at
that Time, was, to get up into a thick bufliy Tree
like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near .me, and
where I ielblv'd to fit all Night, a.n4 confider the
next. Day what Death I fliould die, for as yet J
faw no Profpeci of Life ; I walk'dabpjtt a Furlong
from the'Shore, to fee iflcouldfind.ariy frefti Wa-
ter to drink, which I did, to my great Joy > and bar
vin'g drank, and put a little Tobaccom my Mouth
'to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and get*
ting up into it, endeavour a to place myfelf Co, as
that if I Jhould deep, I might not fall t and having
cut me a fhort Stick, like a Truncheon, for my
Defence, I took up my Lodging, arid having been
exceffivejy fatigu'd, I fell jfaft afleep, and flept a$
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done
in my ^Condition, and found myfelf the moft. re^'
freih'd with it, that I think I ever was onkchan
Occafipn,.

When Lwak'd, it was broad Day, the Weather
clear, and the Storm abated, fo that tbc Sea did
not rags.and (well as before: But that which fur-
prii-'d me. mpft, was, that the Ship was lifted off
in the. iNigfot from the Sand iffhete flw lay, by
the Swelling of- the Tide, and wa&;dtivsn »p air
moft as fat as theRock, which ifirfl.nKriWori'd,
' where



[ 55]

where I had been fo brnis'd by the dafhing me 4-
;ainft it; this being within about a Mile from the
>hore where I was, and the Ship Teeming to ftanU
upright ft ill, I wilh'd my felf on Board, that, at
leaft, I might /aye fome neceflfyry Things far my
tJfe.

When I came dowo from my Appartment in thp
Tree, I look'd about me ag^in, and the jfirft Thing
I found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and
the Sea had tbfs'd her up upon the Land, about:
two Miles on my Right- Hand. I walk'd as far as I
could upon the Shore to have got to h$r,U*t found
a Keck or Inlet of Water between me -and., the
Boat, which was about half a Mile Broad, lb 1
came back for the prefeot, being more intent upon
getting at the Ship, where I hop'd to find fomer
thing for my jprefent Subfiftence.

A little after Noon I found. the Sea very calm,
and the Tide ebb'd fo far out, that I could cone
within a quarter pf a Mile of the Sjbip > and here
I found a frefh renewing of my Grief, for I law
evidently that if we had kept on Board, we had
been all fafe, that is to fay, we had all got iafe
on Shore, and I had not been fo mifera^le as to
be left entirely deftitute of stfl Comfort and Comp-
any, as now I was ; this forced Tears. from my
yes again, but as there was little Relief in that^
I refolv'd, if poffible, to jgef.tp the Ship, .,&!
pull'd off my Cl oaths, for the Weather was hot to
Extremity, and took the Water; but when,$ camp
to the Ship, my Difficulty was ftill greater.: tp
know how to get on Board, for as (he lay a7gtf>up4»
and high out of the Water, there was nathiljg
within my Reach to lay hold t of, I fwam .roupd
her twice, and the fecond Time I fpy'd . f % .fmaJl
Piece of a Rope, which I wonder 1 did npt fee
at firft, hang down by the Fore-Chains fo low,

E 4 as



g



'■[#']

*i that with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and
by the help of that Rope, * got up into theFore-
caftle of the Ship, here I found that the Ship was
bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold,
tut that fhe lay fo on the Side of a - Bank of hard
Sand, or rather Earth, and her Stern lay lifted up
upon the Bank, and her Head low almoft to
the Water ; by this Means all her Quarter was
free; and all th^t was in that Part was dry;
for you m^y be fure my firft Work was to fearch
pnd to fee what was fpoii'd, ai.d what was
free ; and firft, I found that all the Ship's Pio-
irifions were dry and 1 untouched by the Water,
and being very well difpos'd to eat, I went to
the Pread-Room and fili'd my Pcckets with Bif-
"Jret, and eat it as I went about other Things,
for I had no time to loft ? I alfp found feme Rum
in the gre^t Cabin, of which I took, a large
3Mmi and which I had indeed need enough of
to fpirit me for what was before me : Now I
Vented npthing but a Boat to furnjfti ipyfelf with
itoany Things which I forefaw would be very ne-
f effary to me.

It was in vain to fit ftill and wife for what was
not to be had, arid this Extremity rouz'd my
Application ; we^had feveral fpare Yards, and
two or three latge' Sparrs of Wood, and a fpare
Top-mafl pr two in the Ship ; I refolv'd to fall to
uroifc with thefe, and flung as many of them
pver Boarcl, as I -could manage for th$ir Weight,
tying every one with a Rope, that they might
nipt drive away ; when this was done I went down
the 'Ship** Side, -and pulling them to me, I ty d
foer of them fail: together ot both Ends as well
as J- could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying
|wo or -three fliort Pieces of Plank upon them
crofs-ways, I found \ could walk upon it very

v.ell a



[57]

well, but that it was not able to beat any gfeit
Weight, the Pieces being top light ,• (o I went to
work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a fpare
Top-maft into three Lengths, and added them to
my Raft, wi^h a great deal of Labour and Pain?,
but hope of furnifhing my felfwith Ncceifaries, en-
couraged me to go beyond what I fliOuld have been
able to have done upon another Occafion.

My Raft was now ftrong enough to bear any
reafonable Weight ; my next Care was what to
load it with, and how to preferve what I laid upon
it from the Surf of the Sea ; but I was not long con-
fidering this, I firft laid all the Planks or Boards up-
on it that I could get, arid having confider'd well
what I moft wanted, I firft got three of theSea-
mens Chefts, which I had broken open and empty *d*
and lower'd them down upon my Raft ; the firft
-of thefe I filled w.th Provifions, w. Bread, Rice,
three Dutch Cheefes, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's
Flefli, which we liv*d much upon, and a little Re-
mainder of European Corn, which had been laid by
for fome Fowls which we brought to Sea with us,
but the Fowls were kiird ,• there had been fome
Barly and Wheat together, but, to my great Dif-
appointment, I found afterwards that the Rats had
saten or fpoiTd it all ; as for Liquors, I fouhd ftf-
veral Cafes of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, in
which were fome Cordial Waters, and in all about
five or fix Gallons of Rack, thefe I ftow'd by
themfelves, there being no need to put them intb
the Cheft, nor no room for them. While I was
doing this, I found the Tids begin to flow, tho'
very calm, and I had the Mortification to fee my
Coat, Shirt, and Wafr<:oat, whidil had left on
Shore upon the Sand, fwim Sway; as for my
Breeches, which were only Linnenand open-knee'd*
I fwam on Board in them and my Stockings ;. How-
ever



it '58 ]

*vcr this put rac upon rummaging for Cloaths, of
tyhich 1 found enough, but took no more than I
.wanted for prefcnt Ufe, for I had other Things
which my Eye was more upon, as firft Tools to
work with on Shore, and it was after long fearch-
ing that I found out the Carpenter's Cheft, which
was indeed a very ufefal Prize to me, and much
more valuable than a Ship Loading of Gold would
have been at that time ; 1 got it down to my Raft,
xven whole as ic was, without lofin^ Time to look
into it, for I knew in general what it contained.

My next Care was for fome Ammunition and
Arms ; there wei;c two very good Fowling-Pieces
in the great Cabin, and two Piftols, thefe I fe-
curM firft, wirl) fome Powder- Horns, and a fmall
Bag of Shot, and two old rufly Swords : I knew
th$re were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship,
but knew not where our Gunner had ftow'd them,,
but with much Search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, thofe
two I got to my Raft, with the Arms, and now
I thought my (elf pretty well freighted, and be-
gan to think how I (hould get to Shore with them,
having neither Sail, Oar, or Rudder, andtheleaft
Cap Ml of Wind would have overfetall my Na-
vigation.

I had three Encouragements. 1. A fmooth
calm Sea. 2. The Tide riling, and fetting in to
the Shore. 3. What little Wind there was blew
lqe towards the Land ; and thus, having found two
or three broken Oars belonging to the Boat, and
bejfides the Tqols which were in the Cheft, I found
two Saws, an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this
Cargo I put to Sea : For a Mile, or thereabouts my
Ratt went very well, only. that I found it drive a
little diftapt from ^fre Place where I had landed be-
fore, by which J perefciv'd that there was fome In-
draft

draft of the Water* and confequedtiy I hop'd t*
find fome Creek or River there, which I might
pi?ke ufe of as a Port to get to Land with my

Cwgo*
As I imagk'd, fa it was, there appeared befot?

me a little opening of the Land, and J found a
ftrong Current of the Tide tofetintQ it, fo I gui-
ded my Raft «s wdJ as I could to keep in the Mid-
dle of the $$reaB^: But here I had like to hat?
fuflfer'd a fecond Shipwreck, which, if I had, I
think verily wopld harve broke mv Heart, for know-
ing nothing of the Coaft, my EL*f t nja a-ground
at one End of it upon, a Shoal, and not being a-*
ground at the other End, it wanted but a little
that ail my Cargo had flipped off towards that
End that was a-floa?, and fo iali'ri into the Wa-
ter : I did my utmoft by fetting my Back againft
the Chefts, to keep them in their Places, but could
not thruft off the Raft with all my Strength neir*
ther durft I ftir foom the Pofture I was in, but bold*
ing up the Chefts with all my Might, flood in that
Manner near half an Hour, in which time the fi-
fing of the Water brought me a little more upon a
Level, and a little after, the Water ftill riling, my
Raft floated again, and I -thruft her off with the
Oar I. bad, into the Channel, and then driving up
higher, I. at length found my felf in the Mouth o£
a little River, with Land on both Sides, and a
Jftrbng Current or Tide running 'Up,* I look'd on
both Sides for a proper Place to get to Shore, for
i was not willing to be driven too high up the
River, hoping in time to fee fome Ship at Sea,
and therefore refolv'd to place my felf as near the
Coaft as I could.

At length 1 fpy'd a little Cove on the right
Shone of the Creek, to which with great Pain and
Difficulty I guided my. Raft, and at hft got f o near,
,■■..• as



[<fo]:

as tha£ rtaching Ground with my Oar, I could
thru ft her diredfcly in, but here I had like to have
dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again ; for that Shore
lying . pretty fteep, that is to fay flopiog, therfc
was no Place to land, but where one fend of my
Float, if it run on Shore, would lie fo high, and
the other fink lower as before.* that it would en-
danger my Cargo again : All tnac I could do, was
to wait 'till the Tide was at the high eft, keeping the
Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side
of it faft to the Shore, near a flat Peice of
Ground which 1 expelled the Water would flow
over ; and fo it did : As foon as I found Water
enough, for my Raft drew about a Foot of Water, 1
thruft her on upon that flat Piece of Ground, and
there faften'd or mor'd her by ftickmg roy rwo
broken Oars into the Ground* one on one Side
near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End ; and thus I lay till the Water ebb'd a-
way, and left my Raft and all roy Cargo fafe on
Shore,

My next Work was to view the Country, and
feck a proper Place for my Habitation, and where
to flow my Goods to fecure them from whitevei:
might happen 5 where I was, I yet knew -not, whe-
ther on the Continent or on ataliland, whether in-
habited, or not inhabited; whether in Danger of
wild Beafts or not: There was a Hill not ibovc
aMile from me, which rofcup very ftcep and frigh,
and which fcem!d -to over-top fame other Hills
which lay as in a Ridge from k Northward ; 1 took
©tit one of the Fowling- Pieces, and one of the Eft-
ftols, and-an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I
travelled for Difcbvery up to the Top of that Hilli
whereafter 1 had With great Labour and Difficul-
ty got to the Top* I faw my Fate to my great
Affii&ion, (viz.)thte 1 wasip an lilaqd environed
«.: every



Mi]



every Way with the Sea, no Land to be fcen,
cept fome Rocks which lay a great Way off, an<i
twofmall Iflahds left than this, which lay about
three Leagues to the Weft.

I found alfo that the Ifland I was in was barren*
and, as I faw g£od Reafon to believe, un-inhabited,
except by wild Beafts, of whom however I faw.
none, yet I J(aw abundance of Fowls, but knew
not. their Kinds, neither when I kitt'd them could
I tell what was fit for Food, and tfhat not > at my:
coming back, I (hot at a great Bird which I faw
fitting upon a Tree on the Side of a great Wood, I
believe it was the firft Gun that had been * fije'd
there fince the Creation of the World; I had.. no
fooner fitfd, but frt>m all. the Parts. of the Wood
there arofe an innumerable Number of Fowls of
many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and
Crying, every one: according to his. ufual Note >,
but not one of them of any Kind that I knew : As ,
for the Creature Ilcill'd, I took it to be a Kind of
a Hawk, its Colour and Beak refemWing. it, but
had no Talons or Claws more than common, its
Flefli was Carrion, and fit for nothing.

Contented tfrith this Difcovery, I came back to
my Raft, and fell to Work to bring my Cargo on
Shore, which took me up the, reft of that Day, and
what to do with my felf at Night Tkncw not, nor
indeed where to reft ; for I was afraid to lie down
on the Ground, not knowing but fome wild Beaft
might devour me, tho', as I afterwards found*
there was really no Need for thofe Fears.

However, as well as I could, I barricado'd my
felf round with the Cherts and Boards that I had
brought on Shore, and made a kind of a Hut for.
that Night's Lodging; asforFood> Iyetfawnot-.
which Way to fupply my felf, except that I had

fcen



feen two or three Creatures like Hare? run out of
the Wood where I fhoc the Fowl. - ■ ■

I now began to confider, that I might yet get &
great many Things out of the Ship, which would
be ufeful to me, and particularly fome of the Rig-
ging, and Sails, and fuch other Things as might:
come to Land, and IreiblvUtomake another Voy-
age on Board the VcflcJ, i£ poffibfe ; and as I
knew that the firft Storm that blew mflftneceflarity*
bceakhet alt in Pieces,. I reibfr'd to fet all ether
Things apart, 'till! got every Thing out of the
Ship that I could get • then I called la Council, that
is to fay^ in my Thoughts, whether I fhouldtakc
talk'the Raft, but this appeared impracticable ; fo
I rcfolvM to go as before, when the Tide was
down, and I did fo,- only that I ftripp'd before I
went from my Hntt, having nothing but a che-
quered Shirt, a Fair- of Linnen Drawers, and a Pair
of Pumps on my Feet.

I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepared
a fecond Raft, and having had Experience of the
firft, I neither made this fo trnweildy, nor loaded
it fo hard, but yet I brought away fcverai Things
very ufeful to me y as firft, in the Carpenter's Stores
I found two or three Bags full of Nails and Spikes,
a great Skrew-Jack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets,
and above all, that moft ufeful Thing call'd a
Grind-ftone ; all thefe I fecur'd together, with fc-
verai Things belonging to the Gunner, particular-
ly two or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of
Musket-Bullets, feven Muskets, and another Fow-
ling-Piece, with fome fmall Quantity of Powder
more,* a large Bag full of fmall Shot, and a great
Roll of Sheet-Lead : But this wasfo heavy, I could
fiot hoife it up to get it over the Ship's Side.

Befides thefe things, I took all the Mens Cloaths
that I could find, and a fpare Fore-top-fail, a Ham-
mock,



[ ■<& ]

mock and fame Bedding; and mtfc this I loaded
&f fecond Raft, and brought then* aM &fe on Shore?
to my very great Comfort

I was under fome Apprebcrlfiarra during my A^
fence from the Land, that'at lead my Provifion*
mrght be devouf'd On Shore ; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Vifitor* oaly there fat X
Creature like a wild Cat upon one of theCh^fts^
which when Lcame towards it, *afl atfay a little
Diftance, and then ftood ftiflf fhe&t very coto~
pos'd> and unccmcerrfdy and to^M&lltft my Facie,
as if {he had a Mind to be acquainted with tnt, I
prefented my Gun at her, but ag (he did nor fender*
{land it, (he waa perfe&ly uncOficerri'd at it, aar
didfee offer to Air away ; upon whkh I tok'd hit
a bit of Bisket, tho* by the Way I was not vttf
free of it 9 for my Store was not grew : Ho#ever r
I fpar'd her a bit, I fay, -and ffie went toit, fmetftt-
of it, and eat it, and JookM (as pleased) for mote**
but I thank'd her, and could (pare no more ; fo Atf'
march'd off.

Having got my fecond Cargo on Shore, tho J I
was fain to open the Barrels of Powder, and bring
them by Parcels, fo they were too heat y, being
large Casks, I went to work to make me a little
Tent with the Sail and (ome Poles which I cut foe
that purpofe, and into this Tent I brought every
Thing that I knew would fpoil, either with Rain
or Sun, and I piled all the empty Cherts and Casks.
up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it froifcav
ny fudden Attempt, either from Man or Bead.

When I had done this I block'd up the Door of
the Tent with fome Boards within, and an empty
Chert fet up an End without, and fpreading one
of the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pi-
ftols jnft, at my Head and my Gun at Length by
me, I went to Bed for the firft Time, and flepc

fety qdittly all Night,, for I was very weary, and
heavy* for the Night before I had flept little, and
had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to fetch all
thofe Things from the Ship, . as to get them on
§hore»

.1 had the biggeft Magazine of all Kinds now :
t&at ever were laid up, I believe, for one Man ;
but I was not/atisfy'd ftill ; for while the Ship fat
upright in that Fofture* J thought I ought to get
every Thing out of her that I could ,• fo every E&y
at low Water I went on Board* and brought away
f$me Thing or, other : But particularly the third
Tipel went, I brought away as much of the Rig*
gingas I could, asalfo all the fmall Ropes and
Rppe-twine I could get, with a Piece of fpare Can-
vafs* which was to mend the Sails upon Occasion,
tj*c Barrel of wet Gup-Powder : In a Word,I brought
^y/ay all the Sails firil and laft, only that I was
fyji} to cut them in Pieces, and bring as much at a
Time as I could $ for they were.no jnoteufeful to
be Sails, but as meer Canvafs only.

. But that which comforted me more ftill, was,
that at laft of all, after I had made five or fix fuch
Voyages as thefe, and thought I had nothing more
to exped from the Ship that was worth my med-*
lkig with, I fay* after all this, I found a great Hog-
fhead of Bread, and three large Runlets of Rum or
Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine
Flower } this was furprizing to me, becaufe I had
given over expe&ing any more Provifions, except
what was fpoil'd by the Water ; I foon onpty'd the
Hogfliead of that Bread, and wrapt it up, Parcel
by Parcel, in Pieces of the Sails, which I cut out,-
and in a Word, I got all this fafe on Shore alfo.

. The next Day I made anothef Voyage; and
now havingplunder'd the Ship of what was porta-
ble



Ible and fit to hand out, 1 b^gan with the Cables *
and cutting the great Cable into Piecs, fuch as
I could move, I got two ^ ables a«id a Hawfer on
Shore, with all the Iron-work I could get-, ana
having cut down the >ptittail vard, ami the Viii-
fen-yard,and every T hfug I could to maU a larye
Raft 3 I loaded with it all thofc heavy Gnods, and
came away : but my good Luck S.gan no v to
leave mt\ fot this Raft Was foun wet id v\ and fd
over loaden, that after I waschrer'd the Iflrletove^
where I had landed the reft of my Goods, n t be-
ing ab.e to guide it fo handily as! did thcotiicr,
it overfet, and threw me and all my Cargo into
the Watdr-, Is for rtiy felt it was no great Harm 5
for I was near the Shore ; but as to m v. Cargo,
it Was great Part of it loft, efpecially the Ir^rij
wBichlexpe&ed Would have been of gr*at life
tome: However, when the Tide was out, I g c.
ihoftof the Pieces of Cable alhore, and fome of
the Iron, tho* with infinite Labour ; for I was faint
to dip for itimothe Water, a Work which fa*
iigu'd me very much : Aftfct this I went every Day
on board, and brought away what Icoiild g:t.

I had been now thirteen Days on Shore, and had
been eleven Times on Board (he Ship-, in which,
Time I had brought away all that one Pair of
Hands could well be fuppos'd capable to bring, tho'
I believe verilyi had the calm Weather held I
fhould have brought away rhfc whole Ship Piece by
Piece: But preparing the 12th Time to go on
Board, I found the Wind begin to rile ; however
at low Witer I went on Board, and rho' I thought
lbad rumag'd the Cabin fo eflfevShiallyjas that ho^
thing more could be found, yet I difcover 'd a Lock-
er with Drawers in it, in oiicof which Ifoiitld twd
v or three Razors, and one Pair of large Sciffars*
With fome ten cr a dozen of good Knives and

F Forks §

forks ,- in another I found about Thirty fix Pound i
value in Money, fome European Coin, fome Brajil^
fottie Pieces of Eight, fome Gold, fome Silver,

IfmiTdto myfelfat the Sight of this Money,
ODrug! faid I aloud, what art thou good for?
Thou art not worth to mc } no not the taking 6S
of the Ground, one of thofe Knives is worth all
this Heap, I have no Manner of ufe for thee, e'en
tcmafa where thou art, and go to the Bottom as
a Creature wbofe Life is not worth faving. How-
ever upon fecond Thoughts, I took it away, and
tvrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, 1 began
to think of making another Raft, but while I was
preparing this, I found the Sky over caft, and the
Wind began to rife, and in a Quarter of an Hour
it blew a frefti Gale from the Shore -, it prefentiy
occur'd to me, that it was in vain to pretend to
make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that
It was my Bufinefs to be gone before the Tide of
Flood began, otherwife I might not be able to
teach the Shore at all : Accordingly 1 let my
felf down into the Water, and (Warn crofs the
Channel, which lay between the Ship and the
Sands, and even that with Difficulty enouah, part-
ly with the Weight of the Thirgs I had about me,
and partly the roughnefs of the Water, for the
Wind rofe very haltily, and before it was quite
high Water, it blew a Storm.

But I was got Home to my little Tent, where
I lay with all my Wealth about me vfry fecure.
It blew very hard all that Night* and in the Morn-,
ing w hen I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to
bcl'cen ; I was a little furpnVd, but recovered my
fclfwith this fat: is ta&ory Refle&ion, viz.. That I
had loft no Time, nor abated no Diligence to gee
every Thing out of her that could be ufeful to me,
and that indeed thete was little left in her that 1

was



. t «7" ]

Was able to briug away, if 1 had had mote
Time.

1 now gave over any more Thoughts of the
Ship, or of any Thing out of her, excepe what
might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed
divers Pieces of her afterwards did -, hut thofe
Thiiigs wete of (mall ufe to me.

My Thoughts were now wholly empJoy'd a-
bout fecuring tjiy felf either againft Savages, if a-
ny (hould appear, or wild Beafts.if any were in the
Iiland -,and I had many Tbo iqhts of the Mechod
how codothis,aad whit kind nfDvvelliagtD make,
whether I fhould make me a Cave in the Earth, or
a Tent upon the Earth : And, in (hort, I refolv'd
upon both, the Manner and Defcription of which
it may not be improper to give an Account of.

I foon found the Place I was in was not for my
Settlement particularly becaufe it was upon a low
moorifli (Ground near the Sea, and I believtt
Would not be wholefome, and more particularly
fcecaufe there was no frefh Water near it, fa I re-
folv'd to find a more healthy and more convenient
Spot of Ground.

Iconfulted fcveral Things in my Situation
which I found would be proper forme, I ft. Health,
and frelh Water I juft now mention'd. idly, Shel-
ter from the Heat of the Sun. jdly, Security from
ravenous Creatures, whether Men or Beafts. 4thly,
a View to the Sea, that if God fent any Ship in
Sight, I might not lofe any Advantage for my
Deliverance, of which I was not willing to baniOi
all my Expe&ation yet.

^ In fearch of a Place proper for this, I found a
little Plain on the fide of a rifing Hill, whofe
Front towards this little Plain was fteep as a
Houfe-fidc, fo that nothing could come down
upoa me from the Top ; on the fide of this Rock

F % there



- [ .58 ]

there was a hollow Place worn a little Way ni
like the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there Was
not really any Cave or Way into the Rock at all.

On the flat of the Green, juft befote this hollow
Place, I refolv'd to pitch my Tent t This Plain was
not above an hundred Yards broad, and about
twice as long) and lay like a Green before my
Door, and at the End of it defcended irregularly
every Way down into the low Grounds by the
Sea-fide. It was on the N.N.fV. Side of the Hill,
fo that I was fhelter'd from the Heat every Day,
till it came to a W. and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in thofe Countries is neat the Setting.

Before I fet up my Tent, I drew a half Circle

before the hollow Place, which took in about ten

Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Pvock, and

twenty yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning

*£nd Ending.

In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of ftrodg
Stakes, driving them into the Ground till they
flood very firm like Piles, the biggeft End being
out of the Ground about five Foot and and an half,
and fharpen'd on the Top ; the two Rows did not
fland above fix Inches from one another.

Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut
in the Ship, and laid them in Rows one upon
another, within the Circle between thcife two
Rows of Ftakes, up to the Top, placing other
Stakes in thelnlide, leaning againft them, about
two Foot and a halt h'gh, like a Spur to a Poft,
and this Fence was fo ftrong, that neither Man or
Beaft could get into it or over it : This coft me
a great deal of Time and Labour, efpecially to cut
the Piles in the Woo<ls, bring them to the Place^
and drive them into the Earth.

The Entrance into this Place I made to be not
by a Door, but by a fliort Ladder, to go over

the



[*9]

the Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I lifted
over after me, and fo I was compleatly fenced in,
and fortify'd, as I thought, from all the World,
and confequently fleptf fecure in the Night, which
otherwife I could not have dbne, tho* as it appear'4
afterward, there was no need of all this Caution
from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.

Into this Fence or Fbrtrefs, with infinite La-
bour, I carry'd all my Riches, all my Provifions,
Ammunition and Stores, of which you have the
Account above, and I made me a largeTent, which
to preferve me from the Rains, that in one Part of
the Year are very violent there, I made double, viz,.
one fmaller Tent within, and one JargerTent above
it, and covered the uppermoft with a large Tar-
paulin which I had lav'd among the Sails.

And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed
which I had brought on Shore, but in a Ham*
mock, which was indeed a very good one, and be-?
long'd to the Mate of the Ship.

Into this Tent I brought a:l my Provifions, and
every Thing that would fpoil by the Wet, and ha-
ving thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, and fo
pafsM and repafs'd, as I faid, by a (hort Ladder.

When 1 had done this, I began to work my Way
into the Rock, and bringing all the . Earth and
Stones that I dug down out thro* my Tent, I laid
'em up within my Fence in the Nature of a Ter-
ras, that fo it rais*d the Ground within about a
Foot a half; and thus I made me a Cave juft be-
hind my Tent, which fcrv'd me like a Cellar to
my Houfe.

It coft me much Labour, and many Days, be*
fpre all thefeThings were brought to Perfection, and
therefore I muft go back to fome orher things which'
took up fome of my Thoughts. At tlie fame time it

F 3 happned,



[7°]

happen'd after I had laid ray Scheme for the fet-
ting up my Tent, and making the Cave, that a
Siorm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a
fudden Flalh of Lightning happen'd, and after
that a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the
Effect of it ; I was hot fo much furpriz'd with
the Lightning, as I was with a Thought which
darted into my Mind as fwift as the Lightning it
felf : O my Powder ! my very Heart funk within
me, when I thought, that at one Blaft all my
Powder my be deftroy'd ; on which, not my De-
fence only, but the providing me Food, as J
thought, entirely depended ; I was nothing near
fo anxious about my own Danger, tho* had the
Powder took lire, 1 had never known who had
hurt me.

Such Impreflion did this make upon me, that
after the Storm was over, I laid afide all my
Works, my Buildings, and Fortifying, and ap-
ply 'J my fe f to make Bags and Boxes to feparate
thw Powder, and keep it a little and a little in a
Pared, in hope, that whatever might come, it
might not all take Fire at once, and to keep it fq
apart, that it fhould not be po!Iib!e to make one
Part fire another. I finilhM this Work in about a
Fortnight, and I think my Powder, which in all
was about 240 lb. weight, was divided, m not lefs
than a hundred Parcels ; as to the Barrel that had
been wet, I did not apprehend any Danger from
that, fo I plac'd if in my new Cave, which in my
I^ancy I calfd my Kitchin, 4nd the reft I hid up
Send down in Holes among the Rocks, fo that no
wet might come to it, marking very carefully
where I laid it. * ?

: In rl}e Jnterval pf time while this was doing, I

[7*1

thing fit for Food, and as nea r as I could to ao««-
quaint my fclf with what the Ifland produced. The
hrft time I went out I prefently difcover'd that
there were Goats in the Ifland, which was a great
Sitisfa&ion to me ; but then it was attended with
this Misfortune to me, viz.* That they were So
fhy, fo fubtile, and fo fwift of Foot, that it was
the difEculteft thing in the World to come at them :
But I was not difcourag'd at this, not doubting
but I might now and then flioot one, as itfoon hap-
pen'd, for after I had found their Haunts a little,
1 laid wait in this Manner for them : I obfetv'd if
they (aw me in the Valleys, tho* they were upon
the Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible
Fright ; but ii they were feeding in the Valleys,
and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice
of me, from whence I concluded, that by the
Pofition of their Opticks, their Sight was fo di-
rected downward, that they did not readily fee
Objefts that were above them; fo afterwards I
took this Method, I always climbed the Rocks firft
to get above them, and then had frequently a fair
Mark. The firft foot I made among thefe Crea-
tures, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little Kid
by her which fhe gave fuck to, which griev ? d me
heartily ; but when the Old one fell, the Kid
flood flock flill by her till I came and took her up,
and not only fo, but when I carried the Old one
with me upon my Shoulders, the Kid followed
me quite to my Enclosure, upon which I laid down
the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and
parried it over my Pale, in hopes to have bied it
up tame, but it would not eat, fo was 1 fore'd to
kill it and eat it my fclf; thefe two fupply'dme
with Flefira great while, for I eat fparingly ; and
fav'd my Provisions (my Bread efpecialiy) as much
jis pofi&ble L could. . .
: *: " ' F 4 Having



[7*3

Having now fix ? d my Habitation, I found it ab-
folute!) 1 eccilary to provide a Place to make *
Five m, ana tcwel to bi.rnj and what I did for
that, as a'fo how I enlarged my Cave, and what
Conveniences 1 made, I (hall give a full Account
of in its Place : But I muft tirft give fome little
Accointofmy feU, and cf my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well b? fuppofed were not
a few.

I had a difm^l ProfpeS of my Condition, for as
I was not cdft away i pon that Illand without be-
ing driven, as is faid, by a violent Storm quite out
of the Coi rf: of our intended Voyage, and a great
Way, viz,, fome hundreds of Leagues out of the
ordinary Courie of the Trade of Mankind, I had
great Reafon to confider it as a Determination of
Heaven, that in this djolate Place, and in this
difolate Manner 1 fhould end my Life ; the Teats
would run p'cntifily down my Face when I made
thefe R*fleo.io s, and lemetimes I would expoftu-
late with my kit, Why Providence fiiould thus
compleatly ruin us Geatuies and render them
fo abfolutely mifcrabl-*, fo without Help aban-
don'd, fo entirely deprefs'd, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for fuch a Life.

But fomething always returned fwift upon me to
pheck thefe Thoughts, and to reprove me; and
particularly or,e Day walking with my Gun in my
Hand by the Sea fide, I was very pehfive upon the
Subjeft of my prefent Condit'on, when Reafon as
it were expoitulared with me t'other Way, thus:
Well, you are in a defol ate Condition 'tis true, but
pray remember, Where are the reft of you ? Did
not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where
are the Ten ? Why were not they fav'd and yon
loft? Why were you fingledout ? Is it better to be
here or there ? And then I pointed to the Sea. All
. l ' '• Evil*



[7$1



Evils are to be confider'd with the Good that is ift
them, and with what worfe attends them.'

Then it occui'd te me again, how well I was
farnifli'd for my Sublicence, and what would have
been my Cafe if it had not happen'd, Which was
an Hundred Thou/and to One, that the Ship floated
from the Place where (he firft fluids -and was dri-
ven fo near to the Snore, that I had Time to get
all thefe Things out of her : What would have
been my Cafe, if I had been to have liv'd in the
Condition in which I at firft came on Shore, with-
out Nccdlaries of Life, or Necefl'aries to fupply
and procure them ? Particularly, faid I aloud, (thef
to my felf) wnat Ihouki I have done without a
Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools
to make any thing, or to work with, without
Cloaths, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of
Covering, and that now I had all thefe to a fuffi-
cient Quantity, and was in a fair way to provide
my felt in fixh a manner, as to Lve without
my Gun when my Ammunition was fpent; fo
that I had a tolerable View of fubfiftirg without
any Want as long as I hVd ; for I confider'd from
the beginning how 1 would provide for the Acci-
dents that might happen, and for the Time that
was to come, even not only after my Ammunition
{hould be fjent, but even after my Health or
Strength (hould decay.

I confefs 1 had not cntertaiVd any Notion of my
Ammunition being deiiroy'dat one Blaft, I mean,
my Powder be ng blown up by Lightning, and this
made the Thoughts ofitfo iurprizingio mewhen
it lighten'd and thunder'd, as I obferv'd juft now.

And 'now being to enter into a melancholy
Relation of a Scene of (ilent Life, fuch perhaps as
was never heard of in the World before, I fiiaU
take it from its Beginning, and continue it in its

/ Order.

Order. It was, by my Account, the joth of Sept.

when, in the Manner as abovefaid, Ifirft fet Foot

rn* this horrid Ifland, when the Sun being, to
ip ns Autumnal Equinox, was almoitjuftover
iny Head, for I reckoned my felr, by Obfervatioa,
to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees %z Minutes,
North of the Line.

Alter I had been there about ten or twelve
Pays, it came into my Thoughts, that I fhould
lofe my Reckoning of Time for want of Books
and Pen and Ink, and fhpuld even forget the Sab-
bath Days from the working Days ; but to prevent
this, I cut it with my Knite upon a large Poft, in
Capital Letters, and making it into a great Crofs,
I fet it up on the Shore where I tirft landed, viz.. I
came on Shore here on the- 30th of Sept. 1^59. l/pon
the Sides of this fquare Poll, I cut every Day a
Notch with my Knire, and every feventh Notch
was as long again as the reft, and every firft Day of
the Month as long again as that long oqe, and thus
I kept my Kalcnder, oc weekly, monthly, and
yearly reckoning of Time.

In the next Place we are to obferve, that among
the many Things which I brought out of the Ship
in the fevcral Voyages, which as abovemention'd,
I made to it, I got feveral Things of lefs Value,
but not at all lefs ufeful to me, which I omitted
fetting down before ; as in particular, Pens, Ink,
and Paper, feveral Parcels in the Captain's, Mate's,
Gunner's, and Carpenter's keeping, three or four
CompaiTcs, fome Mathematical Inftruments, Di-
als, Pcrlpctiivcs, Charts, and Books of Navigati-
on, all which I huddied together, whether I might
want them or no •> alfo 1 found three very good
Bibles, which came to me in my Cargo from Eng-
(andy and which I had pack'd up among my Things;
lomc Po, tu&ueiA Books alfo, ag$i ^mong them two

or

at three Popifli Prayer-Books, and feveral other
Books ; all >vhich I carefully lequt'd And I muft
not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and
two Cats ; of whofe eminent Hiftory, j may have
Occafion to fay fomething in it* Pl^Cf ; for I car*
ry'd both the Cats with, me ; and as tor the Dog,
he jump'd out of the Ship of himfel£ ^nd /warn
on Shore tp me the Pay aftpj I went on Shore
with my firfi Cargo, and was a trufty Servant to
me many Years : I wanted nothing h£ coulfi fetch
me, nor any Company that he could make up to
me > I only wanted to have him talk to me, but
that would not do. As I obfprv'd before, I found
Pen, Ink, and Pap^r, and I husbanded thepi to the
utmolt ; and I (hall fhew, that while my Ink la-
fted, I kept Things very exa& ; but after that -was
gone, I could not; for I could not make any Ink,
by any Means that I could devife.

And this put me in mind that I wanted many
things, notwithftanding all that I had amaft'd to-
gether; and of thefe, this of Ink was one, as alfo
Spade, Pick- Ax, and Shovel, to dig or remove
the Earth, Needles, Pins, and Threads as for
Linnen, I foon learn'd to want that without much
pifficulty.

This want of Tools made every Work I did, go
on heavily ; and it was near a whole Year before I
had entirely finifli'd my little Pale or furrounded
Habitation : The Piles or Stakes, which were as
heavy as I could well lift, were a long Time in cut-
ting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in oringing home ; fo that I fpent fometimes two
Days in cutting and bringing home one of thofe
Polls, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground ;
for which Purpofe I got a heavy Piece of Wood
at firft>but at la ft bethought myfelf of one of the
Iron Crows* which however, tho* I found it, yet
' ' ' it



[7*] .

it made driving thofc Pofts or Piles very laborious
and tedious Work.

But what heed I ha* been concerned at the Te-
dioufnefs of any Thing I had to do, feeing I ha4
Time enough to do it in ,• nor had I any other Em-
ployment, if that had been over, at leaft, that I
could forefee, except the ranging the Ifland to feek
for Food, which I did more or lefs every Day.

I now began to confider ferioufly my Conditi-
on, and the Cirtrumftance I was redue'd to, and I
drew up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not fo
much to leave them to any that were to come af-
ter me ; for I was like to have but few Heirs, as
to deliver my Thoughts froip daily poring upon
them, and affli&ing my Mind ,• and as my Rfeafon
began now to mailer my Defpondency, I began
to comfort myfelf as* well as I could, and tofet
the Good againft the Evil, that I might have
fomething to diftinguifli my Cafe from worfe j an4
I ftated it very impartially, like Delator and Cre-
ditor, the Comforts I enjoy *d, againft the Mife-

Upon the whole, here was aii undoubted -Tefii-

Having now brought my Mfnd a little to relifh
my Condition, and given over looking out to Sea,
to fee if I could fpy a Ship; I fay, giving over
thefe Things, I began to apply my felt to accom-
modate my way of Living, and to make Things
as eafy to me as I could.

t have already defcnbed my Habitation, which
was a Tent under the Side of a Rock, (unrounded
with a ftrong Pales bF Polls and Cables,, but 1 might
now rather call it a Wall, for I jrais'd a kind of
Wall up agaioft it of Turfs, ^feout two Foot thick
on the Outilde, and after fome tin*, I think, it
was a Year and haH", 1 rate'd Rafters from it lean-
ing to the Rock, and thatchM or cover'd it with
Boughs of Trees,, and fuch things as I could get to
keep out of flic nain, which I found at fome times
of the Year very violent.

I "have already bbferved how t brought all my
Goods info thia Pale, and into the Cave which I
had made behind me: But I muft obfeive too
that at firft this was a confus'd Heap of Goods,
which as they lay in jio Order, fo they took up
" all my Place ♦ I had no room to turn myfclf i So
I let rayfelf to enlarge my Cave and Works far-
ther into the Earth > for it was a loofe fandy Rock,
Which yielded eafily to the Labour 1 beftowed on
it: And fo when I found I was pretty iafe as to
Beafis of Prey, I workM fideways to the Right
' Hand into the Rock > and then turning to the Right
again, work'd quite out, and made me a Door to
"come out, on the Outfidc of my Pale or Fortiti*
'cation.

This gave me not only Egrefs and Regrefs, as
it were a Back-way to my Tent and to my Store-
houfc, but gave me room to flow my Goods.

And now I began to apply my felf to make fuch
tieceffary things as I found 1 moft wanted, as par-
ticularly a Chair and a Tables for without theft I
was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the
World > 1 could not write or eat, or do feveral
things with fo much Pleafure without a Table.

So I went to work ; and here I muft needs ob*
fervc* that as Reafon is the Subftance and Origi-
nal



C 79 3

nai of the Mathematicks, fo by ftating and fqua-
ring dUry Thine by Reafon, and by making the
moft rational judgment of Things, every Man
may be in time Matter of every mechanick Art, I
had never handled Tool in my Life, and yet in
time by Labour, Application and Contrivance, I
found at laft that I wanted nothing but! could
have made it, eipecially if I had had Tools ; how-
ever, I made abundance of Things, even without
Tools, and fome with nfc moreTools than an Adze
and a Hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite Labour :
For Example, if I wanted a Board, I had no other
Way but to cut down a Tree, fct it on an Edge be-
fore me, and hew it flat on either Side with my
Ax, till I had brought it to be thin as a Plank,
and then dubb it fmooth with my Adze. It is true,
by this Method I could make but one Board out
of a whole Tree, but this I had no Remedy for
but Patience, any more than I bad for the prodi-
dious deal of Time and Labour which it took me
up to make a Plank or Board : But my Time qt
Labour was little worth, and fort was as well cpx-
ploy'd one way as another.

However, I made roe a Table and a Chair, as
I obferv'd above, in the firft Place, and this I did
out of the fhort Pieces of Boards that J brought
on my Raft from the Ship : But when I had
wrought out fome Eoards, as above, I made large
Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and a Half one
over another, all along one Side of my Cave, tt>
lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work, and in z
Word, to feparate every Thing at large in their
Places, that I might come eafily at them ; I knocked
Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to hang my Guns
and all Things that would hang up.

S#



[8o]

So that had my Cave been to be feen, it look 'd
like a general Magazine of all necefTary JThings,
and I had every Thing fo ready at my H5&d y that
it was a great Pleafure to me to fee all my Goods
in fuch Order, and efpccially to find my Stock of
all Neceflaries fo great.

And now it was when I began to keep a Jour-
nal of every Day's Employment, for indeed at firft
I was in too rtiuch Hurry, and not only Hurry
as to Labour, but in too much Difcompcfure of
Mind, and my Journal would ha* been full of many
dull things. For Example, I muft have faid thus :
Sept the 3 oth, After I got to Shore and had efcap'd
drowning* inftead of being thankful to God for
my Deliverance, having firft vomited with the
great Quantity of fait Water which was gotten
into my Stomach, and recovering my felf a little, I
ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beat-
ing my Head and Face, exclaiming at myMifery,
and crying out, I was undone,- undone, till tir'd
and faint I was forced to lye down on the Ground
to repofe, but durft not fleep for fear of being
devourM

Some Days after this, and after I hrd been oh
board the Ship, and got all that I could out of
her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the Top
of a little Mountain and looking oat to Sea in
hopes of feeing a Ship, then fancy at a vaft Di-
ftance 1 fpy'd a Sail, pleafe myfclf with the HopcS
of it, and then after looking lteadily till I was al-
moft blind, lofe it quite, and fit down and weep
like a Child, and thus encreafe my Mifery by my

Folly;

But having gotten over thefe things in fome Mea-
fure* and havingfettled my Houfiiould-Scuff and
Habitation, made me a Table and a Chair, and all
as handfome about me as I could, I began to keep

my journal of which I (hall here give you the
Copy (tho' in it will be told all theie Particulars

The JOURNAL

SEptemier 30, 1659* \ poor miferablc Robin/on
Crufoe, being Shipwreck'd, during a dreadful
Storm, in the Offing, camepri Shore on this dif-
xnal unfortunate Ifland, which I call'd the Ifland

All the reft of the Day I fpent in ajffli&irig my

viz, A had neither Food, Hoiife,Cl6aths, Weapon*
or Place to fly to, and in Defpair of any Relict,

Savages, or ftarv'dtd Death foi: want of Food. Ac

and was driven on Shore again much nearer the
Ifland, which as it vfes fomc Com tort on one hirid$

ried us to fdrtie other Part of the World. I fpent
great part of this Day in perplexing xny felf on
thefe things •> but at length feeing the Ship almoft
dry, 1 went upon the Sand as near as I could, and
then Swam on Board \ this Day alio continu'd rain-
ing, tho' with no Wind at all.

From the ift of Ottober to the 24th. All thefe
Days entirely fpent in many leveral Voyages to
get all I could out of the Ship, which I brought
on Shore, every Tide of Flood, upon Rafts. Much
Rain alio in thele Days, thro' with lbme Intervals •
of fair Weather : But, it leems, this was the rainy
Sealbn.

Oft. 20. I overlet my Raft, and all the Goods
I had got upon it, but being in Ihoal Water, and
the things being chiefly heavy, I recovered many of
them when the. Tide was out.

Oft. 25. It rain'd all Night and all Day, with
lbme Gufts of Wind, during which time the Ship
broke in pieces, the Wind blowing a little harder
than before, and was no more to be feen, except
the Wreck of her, and that only at low Water,
I Ipent this Day in covering" and leaning the Goods
which I had lav'd, that Rain might not Ipoil
them.

Oft. 26. I walk'd about the Shore almoft all
Day to find out a Place to fix my Habitation,
greatly concern'd to lecure my lelf from any Attack
in the Night, either from % wild Beafts or Men.
Towards Night I fix'd upon a proper place under *
a Rock, and mark'd out a Semi-Circle for my En-
campment, which I refolv'd to ftrengthen with a
Work, Wall, or Fortification made of double Piles,
Jin'd within with Cable, and without with Turf.

From the 26th to the 30th I work'd very hard
in carrying all my Goods to my new Habitation

tho*

tho' Ibme part of the time it rain'd exceeding
hard.

The 31ft in the Morning I went out into the
Ifland with my Gun to fee for lbme Food, and dis-
cover the Country ; when I kill'd a She-Goat, and
her Kid followed me home , which I afterwards
Icill'd alfo, becaule it would not feed,

November I . I fet up my Tent under a Rock, and
lay there for the firft Night, making it as large as
1 could with Stakes driving in to living my Ham-
mock upon.

Nov. i. I fet up all my Chefts and Boards, and
the Pieces of Timber which made my Rafts, and
with them fbrm'daFence round me, a little with-
in the Place I had mark'd out for my Fortifi-
cation.

Nov. 3. I went out with my Gun, and Icill'd two
Fowls like Duckg, which were very good Food.
In the Afternoon went to work to make me a
Table.

Nov. 4. This Morning I began td order my times
of Work, of going out with my Gun, time of
Sleep, and time of Diverfion, viz*. Every. Morning
I walk'd dut With my Gun for two or three Hours
if it did not Rain, then eraploy'd rayfelf to work
till about Eleven a-clock, then eat What I had to
live on, and from Twelve to Two I lay down to
fleep, the Weather being exceffive hot, and then
in the Evening to work again : The working Part
pf this Day and the next Were wholly employed
in making my Table, for I was yet but a very lorry
Workman, tho'Tirae and Neceffity made me a
compleat natural Mechanick loan after, as I believe
it would do any one elle.

Nov. $. This Day went abroad with my Gun
and my Dog, and kill'd a wild Cat, her Skin
pretty loft, but her Flefl* good for nothing : Every

G % Creature




C 8 4 J

Creature I kill'd, I took off the Skins and preferv'd
them. Coming back by the Sea-fhore, Ifaw ma-
ny Sorts of Sea- Fowls, which I did not under-
ftand; but was furpriz'd, and almoft frighted with
two or three Seals, which, while I was gazing at,
not well knowing what they were, got into the
Sea, and cfcap'd me for that Time.

Nov. 6. Afcer my Morning Walk, I went to
work with my Table again, and finifh'd it, tho'
not to my Liking; nor was it long before I learn'd
toire;:dit.

Nov. 7. Now it began to be fettled fair Wea-
ther. The 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and Part of the
1 2th, (for the 1 1 th was Sunday, according to my
Reckoning) I took wholly up to make me a Chair,
and with much ado brought it to a tolerable Shape,
but never to pleafe me ; and even in the making I
puird it to Pieces feveral Times. Note, I foon ne-
^glefted my keeping Sunday ; for omitting my Mark
tor theip on myPoft, I forgot which was which.
• Nov* ig.'Thisjpay it rain'd, which refrefli'd me
exceedingly, and cool'd the Earth, but it was ac-
company 'd with terrible Thunder and Lightning,
which frighted me dreadfully, for fear of my Pow-
der : As foon at it was over, I refolv'd to feparate
my Stock of Powder into as many little Parcels as
poffible, that it might not be in Danger.

Nov. 14, 15, 16. Thcfe three Days I fpent in
making little fquare Chefts or Boxes, which might
hold about a Pound, or two Pound, at moft, of
Powder ; and fo putting the Powder in, I flowed
it in Places as fecure and remote from one another,
as poffible. On one of thefe three Days 1 kill'd
a large Bird that was good to eat, but 1 know not
what to call it,

Nov. 1 j. This Day I began to dig behind my
Tent into the Rock, to mal$g room for my fa ther

Conveniency. Note, Three Things I wanted ex-
ceedingly for this Work, yi &. a Pick-ax;- a Shovel*
and a Wheel-barrow or Basket, fo I defifted from
my Work, and began to confider how to fupply
that Want, and make me fome Tools : As for a
Pick-ax, I made life of the Iron Crows, which
were proper enough, tho* heavy ,• but the next
Thing was a Shovel or Spade ; this was fo abfo-
lutely neceffary, that indeed I could do nothing e£-
fedually without it; but what kind of one tp
make I knew not*

Nov. 1 8. The next Day in fearching the Woods
I found a Tree of that Wood, or like it, which
in the Brafils they call the Iron Tree, for its ex-
ceeding Hardnefs ; of this, with great Labour
and almoft fpoiling my Ax, I cut a piece, and
brought it Home too with Difficulty enough, for
it was exceeding heavy,

The exceffive hardnefs qf the Wood; and having
no other way, made me a long white -upon this
Machine ; for I work'd it efte&ually by little
and little into the Farm of a Shovel or Spade*
the Handle exaftly flup'd like ours in England,
only that th? brqad Part having no Iron (hod up-
on it ap tjottom, it would not laft me fo long;
however it ferv'd well enough for the Ufes which
I hjad Qccafion to put it to ,• but never was a Sho-
vel, I believe, made after that F^fhion, pr fa
lppg a making.

I was ftill deficient, for J wanted a Basket or a
Wheel-barrow ; a Basket I could not make by any
means, having no fuch Things as Twigs that woulq
bend to make Wicker Ware, atleaft none yet found
out; and as to a Wheel-barrow, I fancy 'd I could
nmke all but the Wheel, but that I had no Notion
of, neither did I know how to goabout it ; befides
I had no pofflble way to make the Iron Gydgeoqs

G 3 for



[; 8tf ]

for the Spindle or Axis of the Wheel to run in, fo
I gave it over ; and fo for carrying away the Earth
which I dug out of the Cave, I made me a Thing
like a Hodd which the Labourers carry Mortar in,
when they fcrve the Bricklayers.

This was not fo difficult to me as the making
the Shovel ,• and yet this, and the Shovel, and the
Attempt, which I made in vain, to make a Wheels
barrow, took me up no lefs than fpur Days, I mean
always, excepting my Morning Walk with my Gun,
which I feldom fail'd ; and very feldom fail'd alfo
of bringing home fomething fit to eat.

Nlv.- 23. My other Work having now flood ftill,
becaufe of my making thefe Tools ; when they
were finifti'd, I went on, and working every Day,
as my Strength and Time allowed, I fpent eigh-
teen Days entirely in widening and deepning my
Cave, that it might hold my Goods commodi-
oufly, - -

Ncu y During all this Time, I wcrk'd to make
this Rocjn or Cave fpacious enough to accommo-
date me as a Warchoufe or Magazine, a Kitchen,
a •Dining-room, and a Cellar; as for my Lodging,
I kept to the Tent, except that fometimes in the
wet Seafon cf the Year, it rain'd fo hard that I
cou!d w riot keep my felf dry, which caus'd me after-
wards to cover all my Place within my Pale with
long Poles in the Form of Rafters, Ieanirg againft
the Rock, ar.d load them with Flags, and large
Leaves of Trees like a Thatch.

December 10. I began now to think my Cave
or Vault fim'fhcd, when on a fudden (it ieems I
hsd mace it too large ) a great Quantity of Earth
fell down from the Top and one Side, fo much,
that in fhort it frighted me, and not without Rea-
fon too ; for if I had been under it, I had ftever
panted a Grave digger : Upon thisDifafler I had

51 great



^jj^UlMgg



[87]



a great deal of Work to do over again ; for I had
the loofe Earth to carry out, and which was bf
more Importance, I had the Cieling to prop up^rfo
that Imight be fure no more would come down.

Dec. 1 1. This Day I went to work with it accord-
ingly, and got two Shoars or Polls pitch'd upright
to the Top, with two Pieces of Boards a-crofs- over
each Poft ; this I finifh'd the next Pay ; and fetting
more Pofts up with Boards, in about a Week more
J had the Roof fecund ; and the Pofts ftanding in
Rows, fcrv'd me for Partitions to part of my Houfe.

Dec. 17. From this Day to the Twentieth I
placed Shelves, and knocked up Nails on the Pofts
to hang every Thing up that could be hung up,
and now I began to be in fome Order within
Poors.

Dec. 20. Now I carry'd every Thing into the
Cave, and began to ftfrnifh my Houfe and fet up
fome Pieces of Boards, like a Dreffer, to order my
Victuals upon, but Boards began to be very fcarce
with me ; alfo I made me another Table.

Dec. 24. Much Rain all Night and all Day ; no
ftirring out.

Dec. 25. Rain all Day.

Dec. 26. No Rain, arid the garth much cooler
than before, and pleafanter.

Dec: 27. Kill'd a young Goat, and lam'd ano-
ther fo that I catch'd it, and led it Home in a
String ; when I had it Home, I bound and fplinr
ter'd up its Leg which was broke, N. B. I
took fuch care of it, that it liv'd, and the Leg
grew well and as ftrong as ever ; but by nurfing
it fo long it grew tame, and fed upon the little
Green at my Door, and would not go away :
This was the firft Time that I entertained a
Thought of breeding up fome tame Creatures,

G 4 that



[88]

that I might have Food when my Powder and.
Shot was all fpent.

* 'Dec. 28,19, 30. Great Heats and no Breeze; fo
that there was no itirringabrpad, except in the li-
vening for Food ; this Time I fpent in putting all
my Things in Order within Doors.

January 1. Very hot ftill, but I went abroad ear-
ly and late with my Gun, and lay ftill in the middle
of the Day ; this Evening going farther into the
Valleys, which lay towards the Center of the Ifland,
I found there was plenty of Goats, tho' exceeding
fhy and hard to come at, however I refolvM to try
if I could not bring my Dog to hunt them down.

$an. 2. Accordingly, the next Day, I went out
with my Dog, and fat him upon the Goats; but I
was miilaken, for they, all fae'd about upon the
Dog, and he knew his Danger too well, for he

Jan. 3.JI began my Fenceor Wall; which, being
ftill jealous of my being attack'd byfome Body, I
refolv'd to make very thick and ftrong.

N. B. This WaU being defcrib'd before, I
purpofely omit what wasfaid in the 'Jour-
nal; it isfuffiaenttocbferve,tkatiwas
no lefs Time than from the $d of January
to the lAthof April, -working, finishing and
perfecting this WaU, tho' it was no more
than about 24 Yards in Length, being a half
Circle from one Place in the Hock to another
Place about eight Yards from it, the Door
of the Cave being in the Center behind it.

All this Time I work 'd very hard, the Rains
hindering me many Days, nay fometimes Weeks
together ; but I thought I fhould never be perfect-
ly fecure 'till this Wall was finiflTd ; and it is
fcarce.

fcarce credible what inexpreffiblc Labour every
Thing was done with, efpecially the bringing
Piles out of the Woods, and driving them into the
Ground ; for I made them jnuch bigger than I
need to have done.

When this Wall was finifli'd, and the Out-fide
double fene'd with a Turf- Wall raised up clofe to
it, I pes fuaded myf^lf, that if any People were to
come on- Shore there, they would hot perceive any
Thing line a Habitation ; and it was very well
I did fo, as may be obferv'd hereafter upon a ve-
ry remarkable Occafion.

During this Time* I made my Rounds in thp •
Woods for Game every Day when the Rain ad-
mitted me, and made frequent Difcoveries in thefe
Walks of fomething or other to my Advantage;
particularly I found a kind of wild Pidgeons, who
built not as Wood Pidgeons in a Tree, but rather
as Houfe Pidgeons, in the Holes of the Rocks ;
and taking fome young ones, I endeavoured to
breed them up tame, and did fo ; but when they
grew older, they flew all away, which perhaps
was at firft for want of feeding them, for I had
nothing to give them ; however I frequently found
their Nefts, and got their young ones, which was '
very good Meat.

And now in the managing my Houfhold Affairs,
I found my felf wanting in many Things, which
I thought at firft it was impdffible for me to make,

In the nctt Place, I was at a great Lofs for Can-
dle; (o that as foon as ever it was dark, which was
generally by Seven a Clock, I was obliged to go to
Bed : I remember the Lump of Bees-wax with
which I made Candles in my African Adventure,
but I had none of that now ; the only Remedy I
had, was, that when I had kill'd a Goat, I fav'd
the Tallow, and with a little Difti made qf Clay,
which I bak'd in the Sun, to which I added a Wick
of fome Oakum, I made me a Lamp ,• and this
gave me Light, tho a not a clear fteady Light like
a Candle; in the middle of all my Labours it hap-
pen'd, that rummaging my Things, I found a little
Bag, which, as I hinted before, had been fill'd with
Corn for the feeding of Poultry, not for this Vo-
yage, but before, as I fuppofe, when the Ship
came from Lisbon ; what little Remainder of Corn
had been in the Bag, was all devour'd with the
Rats, and I faw nothing in the Bag but Husks and
Duft ; and being willing to have the Bag for fome
other Ufe, I think it was to put Powder in, when
I divided it for fear of the Lightning, or fome fuch
Ufe, I ihook the Husks of Corn out of it en one
Side of my Fortification under the Rock.

It was a little before the great Rains, juft now
mentioned, that I threw this Stuff away, taking no
Notice of any Thing, and not fo much as remem-
bring that I had thrown any Thing there ; wheii
about a Mr nth after, or 'thereabout, I faw fome
few Stalks of fotticthing Green fhooting out of the
Ground, which I fancy'd might be fome Plant I
had not fecn, but I was furpriz'd and perfectly
aflonifh'd, when after a little longer time I faw
about ten or twelve Ears come out, which were
perfeft green Barley of the fame Kind as our Eli-
rQ£ean> nay, as our Eagfifb Barley.

It is impofllble to exprefs {he Aftonifhment and
Confufion pf my Thoughts on this, Occafion ; I
had hitherto a&cd upon no religious Foundation at
all ; indeed I had very few Notions of Religion in
jny Head, or had entertaiji'd any Senfe of any
Thing that had befallen me, otherwife than as a
Chance, or, as we lightly fay, what pleafes God ;
without fo much as enquiring into th$ End of Pro-
vidence in thefp Things, or his Order in gover-
ning Events in the World : But after I faw Barley
grow there, in a Climate which I know was not;
proper for Corn, and efpecially that I knew not
how it came there, it ftartled me ftrangely, and I
began to fuggeft, that God had miraculoufly caus'd
this Grain to grow without any help of Seed
fown, and that it was fo dire&ed purely for my
Suftenance on that wild miferable Place.

This touched my Heart a little, and brought
Tears out of my Eyes, and I began to blefs my
felf, that fuch a Prodigy of Nature Ihould happen
upon my Account ; and this was the more ftrange
to me, becaufe I faw near it flill all along by the
Side of the Rock, fome other ftraggling Stalks,
which prov'd to be Stalks of Rice, and which I
knew, becaufe I had feen it grow in Africa, when
I was afhore there.

I not only thought thefe the pure Produ&ion$
of Providence for my Support, but not doubting,
but that there was more in the Place ; I went all
over that part of the Ifland, where I had been
before peering, in every Corner, and under every
Rock, to fee for more of it, but I could not find
any ; at laft it occurr'd to my Thoughts, that I had
fliook a Bag of Chickens Meat out in that Place,
and then the Wonder began to ceafej and I muft
iconfefs, my religious Thankfiilnefs to God's Pkn-
yi^ence began to abate too upon the difcove-

[90



ring that all this was nothing but what was cam-
toon jtho'I ought to have been as thankful for fo
' ftrange and unforefeen Providence, as if it had
been miraculous ,• for it was really the Work of
Providence as to me, that fhould order or appoint,
that 10 or 12 Grains of Corn fhould remain un-
fpoil'd (when the Rats had deftroy'd all the reft}
as if it had been dropt from Heaven :■ As alfo that I
fliould throw it out in that particular Place where
it being in the Shade of a high Rock, it fprang up
immediately ; whereas if I had thrown it any
. where elfe at that Time, it had been burnt up and
deftroy'd.

I carefully fav'd theEars of this Corn, you may be
..furc in their Seafon, which was about the End of
.jfuncy and laying up every Corn, I rcfolv'd to fow
them all again, hoping in Time to have fome
Quantity fufficipnt to fupply me with Bread ,• but
it was not till the 4th Year that I could allow my
{elf the leaft Grain of this Corn to eat, and even
then butfparingly, aslfhall fay afterwards in its
Order ; for I lo# all that I fow'd the firft Seafon,
by not obferving the proper Time for J fbw'd it
juft before the dry Seafon, fo that it never came
\\p at all, at Ipaft, not as it would have done: Of
which in its' Place.

Jteildes this Barley, there was, as above 20 or
30 Stalks of Rice, which I preferv'd with the fame
Care, and whofe Ufe was of the fame Kind^ or to
the fame Purpofe, (viz,.) to ma^e me Bread, or
rather Food $ for I found Way 5 to cook it up with-
out baking, tho' I did that alfo aftpr fome Time,
But to return to my Journal.

I work'd exceffive hard thefe three or four

'Months to get my Wall clqne;' and the 14th of

jtjpr.il 1 doled it up, contriving to go into it, not

'by a Door, but ever the Wall by a Ladder, that

■'-'■• there



there might be no Sign in the Out-fide of my Ha-
bitation.

April i6l finifh'd the Ladder, fol went up with
the Ladder to the Top, and then puH'd it up after
me, and let it down on the Infide t This was &
compleat Enclofure to me ; for within I had Retail
enough, and nothing could come at me from with*
out, unlefs it could firfl moufot my Wall

The very next Day after this Wall was finifhedj
I had almoft had all my Labour overthrown at
once, and myfelf killed ; the Cafe was thus : As I
was bufy in the Infide of it, behind my Tent, juft in
the Entrance into my Cave, I was terribly frighted
with a moft dreadful furprizing Thing indeed;
for all on a fudden I found the Earth come cruiri^
bling down from the Roof of my Cave, and from
the Edge of the Hill over my -Head, and two of
the Pofts I had fet up in the Cave, crack'd in a
frightful manner : I was heartily feared, but thought
nothing of what was really the Caufe, only think-
ing that the top of my Cave was falling in, as fome
of it had done before; and for fear I fhou'dbe bu-
ry'd in it, I ran forward to my Ladder, and not
thinking my felf fafe their neither, I got over my
Wall for fear of the Pieces of the Hill which I ex-
pefted might roll down upon me; I was no fooner
ftept down upon the firm Grouhd, but I plainly
faw it was a terrible Earthquake, for the Ground I
flood on fhook three times at about eight Mi-
nutes di fiance, with three fuch Shocks, as would
have overturned the ftrongeft Building that could
be fuppos'd to have flood on the Earth ; and a
great Piece of the Top of a Rock, which flood a-
bout half Mile from me next the Sea, fell down
with fuch a terible Ncife, as I never heard in all
my Life : I perceiv'd alfo, the very Sea was put
into violent Motion by it; and I believe the

Shock



C 94 ]

Shocks were flxonger under the Water than On the
Ifland.

I was ib aiijai'd with the Thing it felf, having
never felt the like, or difcourfed with any one that
Bad, that I was like cine dead or ftupify'd -, and the
Motion of the Earth ltiade my Stomach fick, like
one that was tofs'd at Sea j but the Noife of the
filling of the Rock awak'd me, as it were, and rou-
ting me from the ftupified Condition I was in, fill'd
me with Horror, and I thought of nothing then
but the Hill felling upon my Tent, and all my Houfc
hold Goods, and burying fell at Once-, and this
funk my very Soul within me a fecond time.

After the third Shock was over, and I felt no
more for fbme time, I began to take Courage, and
yet I had not Hefcrt enough to get over my Wall a-
gain, for fear of being buried alivfc, but fat fiill
upon the Ground, greatly caft down and difconfb-
late, not knowing what to do : All this while I had
not the leaft ferious religious Thought, nothing
but the common, Lord ha Mercy ufon me j and
when it was over, that went away too.

While I fat thus, I found the Air over-caft, and
grew cloudy, as if it would ram \ fbon after that
the Wind rofe by little and little, fb that in left
than half an Hour it blewamoft dreadful Hurri-
cane : The Sea was all on a fudden cover'd over
with Foam and Froth, the Shore was cover'd with
the Breach of the Water, the Trees were torn up
by the Roots, and a terrible Storm it was} and
this held about three Hours, and then began to
abate, and in two Hours more it was calm, and
began to rain very hard.

All this while I fat upon the Ground very much
terrify'd and deje&ed, when on a iudden it came?
into my Thoughts, that thefe Winds and Rain being
the Confluence of the Earthquake, the Earthquake



■ !!■ II il^M— — i^^ i



[95]



itlelf was (pent and over, and 1 might venture itito
my Cave again : With this Thought my Spirits
began to revive^ and the Rain alfb helping toper-
lwade me, I went in and fat dowa in my Tent,
but the Rain was fo violent, that 'my Tent was
ready to be beaten down with it} and I was forc'd
to go into my Cave, tho' very much afraid and un-
ealy for fear it ihould fell on my Head.

This violent RainTorc'd me to a new Work, viz..
to cut a Hole thro' my new Fortification like a
Sink to let Water go out, which would elfe have
drown'd my Cave. After I had been in my Cave
fome Time, and found ftill no irtore Shocks of the
Earthquake follow, I began to be more compos'd ;
and now to fupport my Spirits, which indeed want-
ed it very much, I went to my littl&.Store, and
took a fmall Sup of Rum, which however I did
then and always very fparingly, knowing I could
have no more when that was gone."

It continued raining all that Night, and great
Part of the next Day, fo that I could not ftir
abroad, but my Mina being more compos'd, I be-
gan to think of what I had beft do, concluding,
that if the Iflandwas iiibjeft to the le Earthquakes,
there would be no living for me in a Cave, but I
ttiuft conlider of building me Ibrne little Hut in an
open Place, which I might furround with a Wall as
I had done here, and fo make my felf lecure from
wild Beafts or Men : But concluded, if I ftaid
where I was, I ihould certainly, one Time or other,
be bury'd alive.

With thefe Thoughts I refolv'd to remove my
Tent from the Place where it flood, which was
juft under the hanging Precipice of the Hill, and
which, if it fhould be fhaken again, would certain-
ly fill upon my Tent : And 1 (pent the two next

Days



[*]

Days, being the i $th and 20th of Aprils in con-
triving where and how to remove my Habitation;

The Fear of being fwallow'd up alive, made
me that I never flept in Quiet,- and yet the Appre-
henfion, of lying abroad without any Fence, was
almoft equal to it : But ft ill when 1 look'd about,
and faw how every Thing was put in Order, how
pleafantly concealed I was, and how fafe from
Danger, it made me very loth to remove.

In the mean time it occurred to me, that it would
require a vaft deal of Time for me to do this, and
that I m uft be contented to run the Venture where
I was, 'till I had form'd a Camp for myfelf, and
had fecur'd it fo as to remove to it : So with this
Resolution I composed myfelf for a Time, and re-
folv'd that I would go to work with all Speed to
build me a Wall with Files and Cables, CXc. in a
Circle as before* and fet my Tent up in it when it
was finiflul, but that I would venture to ftay where
I was 'till it was finiih'd and fit to remove to. This
was the 2 1 ft.

April 22. The next Morning I began to confider
of Means to put this Refolve in Execution, but I
was at a great Lofs about my Tools ; I had three
large Axes and abundance of Hatchets, (for we
earry'dthe Hatchets for TrafEck with the Indians)
but with much chopping and cutting knotty hard
Wood, they were all full of Notches and dull,
andtho'I had a Grindftone, 1 could not turn it and
grind my Tools too ; this coft me as much Thought
as a Statefman would have beftow'd upon a grand
Point of Politicks, or a Judge upon the Lite and
Death of a Man. At length I contriv'd a Wheel
with a String, to turn it with my Foot, that I
might have both my Hands at Liberty: Note, I had
never feen any fuch thing in England, or -at leaft
Rot to take Notice how it was done, tho* fince I

have

have obferv'd it is very common there: : Be(ides
that, my Grind-ftone was very large and heavy*
This Machine coft me a full Week's Work' w bring
it to Perfe&ion.

: jfpriliS, 2,9. Thefe two whole Days I took up
in grinding my Tools, my Machine for turning
my Grind-ftone performing very well.

'jfprit 30. Having perceiv'd my Bread had been
low a great while, now I took a Survey of it, and
reduc ? d myfelf to one Bisket-cake a Day, which
tnade my Heart very heavy.

May 1. In the Morning looking towards- the
Sea-fide, the Tide being low, I faw fomething lie
on the Shore bigger than ordinary 5 and it look'd
like a Cask j when I came to it, I found a fmall
Barrel^ and two or three Pieces of the Wreck of
the Ship, which were driven on Shore by the late
Hurricane 5 and looking towards the Wreck itfelf^
I thought it feem'd to lie higher out of the Water,
that it us'd to do j I examined the Barrel which
was driven. on Shore, and foon found it; was a
Barrel of Gun-powder; but it had taken Water*
and the Powder was cak'd as bard as a Stone 5 how-
ever I roll'd it farther on Shore for the prefent,'and
went on upon the Sands as near as 1 could to*he
Wreck of the Ship to look for more.
. When I came down to the Ship,I found it ftrange-
ly remov'd 5 the Fore-caftle, which lay before bu*
ry'd in Sand, was heav'd up at leaft fix Foot 5 and
the Stern, which was broke to pieces, and parted
from the reft by the Force of the Sea fooh after I
had left rummaging her, was tols'd, as it were, up,
and caft an one Side, and the Sand was thrown
fo high on that fide next her Stern, that whereas
there was a great Place of Water before, fo that I
could not come within a Quarter of a Mile of the
Wreck without fwimming, I could now walk

H quite



L ?° J

quite up to her when the Tide was out 5 I was fur-
priz'd with this at firft, but foon concluded it muft
be done by the Earthquake : And as by this Violence
the Ship was more broken open than formerly, fo
many Things came daily on Shore, which the Sea
had loofen'd, and which the Winds and Water rol-
led by degrees to the Land.

This wholly diverted my Thoughts from the
Dcfign of removing my Habitation $ and I bulled
myfelf mightily, that Day efpecially, in fearching
whether I could make any way into the Ship $ but I
found nothing was to be expe&ed of that kind, for
that all the lnfide of the Ship was choak'd up
with Sand > However, as I had learnt not to defpair
of any thing, I refolv'd to pull every thing to
pieces that I could of the Ship, concluding, that
every thing I could get from her, would be of fome
Ufe or other to me.

May 3. I begun with my Saw, and cut a Piece,
of a Beam thro 9 , which I thought held fome of the
upper Part or Quarter- Deck together, and when
I had cut it thro", I clear'd away the Sand as well
as I could from the Side which lay higheft* but
the Tide coming in, 1 was obliged to give over
for that Time.

May 4. I went a fifhing, but caught not one Fifh
that I durft eat of, till 1 was weary of my Sport j
when juft going to leave off, I caught a young
Dolphin. 1 had made me a long Line of fome
Rope Yarn, but I had no Hooks, yet I frequently
caught Fifh enough, as much as I car'd to eat *
all which I dry'd in the Sun, and eat them dry.

May f. Work'd on the Wreck, cut another
Beam afunder, and brought three great Fir Planks
off from the Decks, which I ty'd together, and
made fwim on Shore, when the Tide of Flood
came on.

May 6. Work'd on the Wreck, got levefal Iron
Bolts out of her, and other Pieces of Iron- work *
work'd very hard, and came Home very much
tir'd, and had Thoughts of giving it over.

May j. Went to the Wreck again, but with an
Intent not to work y but found the Weight of the
Wreck had broke itfelf down, the Beams being cut \
that feveral Pieces of the Ship feem'd to He lopfc,
and the Infide of the Hold lay fo open, that I
could fee into it, but almoft full of Water and Sand.

May 8. Went to the Wreck, and carry'd an Iron
Crow to wrench up the Deck, which lay now
quite clear of the Water or Sand j I wrenched open
two Planks, and brought them on Shore alfo with
the Tide : I left the Iron Crow in the Wreck for
next Day.

May p. Went to the Wreck, and with the Crow
made Way into the Body of the Wreck, and felt
feveral Casks, and loofen'd them with the Crow,
but could not break them up * I felt alfo the Roll
of Englijh Lead, and could ftir it, but it was too
heavy to remove.

May io, 1 1, 1 2, i j, 14. Went every Day to the
Wreck, and got a great deal of Pieces of Tim-
ber, and Boards, or Plank, and z or 300 Weight
of Iron.

May if. I carry'd two Hatchets to try if I
could not cut a Piece off of the Roll of Lead, by
placing the Edge of one Hatchet, and driving it
with the other > but as it lay about a Foot and a
half in the Water, I could not make any Blow to
drive the Hatchet.

May 1 6. It had blow'd hard in the Night, and
the Wreck appear'd more broken by the Force of
the Water* but I {laid fo long in the Woods to get
Pidgeons for Food, that the Tide prevented me
going to the Wreck that Day.

May 17. I faw fome pieces of the Wreck blown
on Shore, at a great Diftance, near two Miles off
me, but refolv'd to fee what they were, and found
it was a Piece of the Head, but too heavy for me
to bring away.

May 14. Every Day to this Day I worked on
the Wreck and with hard Labour I loofen'd fome
Things fo much with the Crow, that the firft
blowing Tide feveral Cask* floated out, and two
of the Scamens Chefts * but the Wind blowing from
the Shore, nothing came to Land that Day, but
Pieces of Timber, and a Hogfhead which had fome
Brazil Pork in it, but the Salt-water and the Sand
had fpoil'd it.

I continu'd this Work every Day to the iyth of
June , except the Time "neccflary to get Food,
which I always appointed, during this Part of my
Employment, to be when the Tide was tip, that 1
might be ready when it was ebb'd out $ and by this
Time I had gotten Timber, and Plank, and Iron-
work fc enongh, to have built a good Boat, if I
had known how; and alfo, I got at feveral Times,
and in feveral Pieces, near 100 Weight of the Sheet-
Lead.

June 16. Going down to the Sea- fide, I found
a large Tortoife or Turtle j this was the firft I had
feen, which it feems was only my Misfortune, not
any Defe6fc of the Place, or Scarcity y for had I
happcn'd to be on the other Side of the Ifland, I
might have had Hundreds of them every Day, as
I found afterwards 5 but perhaps had paid dear
enough for them.

found in her threefcore Eggs 5 and herFleih was to

ceeding thirlly : However, as I had no Water in
my whole Habitation, I was fore'd to lie till Morn-
ing, and went to deep again : In this fecond Sleep,
I had this terrible Dream.

I thought, that I was fitting on the Ground on
the Out-fide of my Wall, where I fat when the
Storm blew after the Earthquake, and that I faw
a Man defcend from a great black Cloud, in a
bright Flame of Fire, and light upon the Ground :
He was all over as bright as a Flame, fo that I
could but juft bear to look towards him •, his
Countenance was raoft inexprefiibly dreadful, im-
poflible for Words to defcribe > when he ftep'd up-
on the Ground with his Feet, I thought the Earth
trembPd, juft as it had done before in the Earth-
quake, and all the Air look'd to my Apprehenfion,
as if it had been fill'd with Flafhes of Fire.

He was no fooner landed upon the Earth, but
he mov'd forward towards me, with a long Spear
or Weapon in his Hand, to kill me $ and when he
came to a rifing Ground, at fome Diftance, he
fpoke to me, or I heard a Voice fo terrible, that
it is impoliible toexprefs the Terror of it * all that
I can fay I underftood was this, Seeing all thefe
Things have not brought thee to Repentance^ now thou
Jbalt die : At which Words, I thought he lifted up
the Spear that was in his Hand to kill me.

No one, that fhall ever read this Account, will
cxpeft that Ifhould be able to defcribe the Horrors
of my Soul at this terrible Vifion, I mean, that even
while it was a Dream, I even dreamed of thofe
Horrors^ nor is it any more poffible to defcribe

the



C 103 ]



the Imprdffion that remain'd upon my Mind, when
I awak'd, and found it was but a Dream.

I had alas ! no divine Knowledge j what I had re-
ceived by thegood Inftru6tion of my Father was then
worn out by an uninterrupted Series, for 8 Years, of
(eafaring Wickednefi, and a conlhnt Converfation
with nothing but fuch as were like myfelf, wicked
and prophane to the laft Degret : I do not remem-
ber that I had in all that time one Thought that fo
much as tended cither to looking upwards toward
God, or inwards towards a Refle&ion upon my
own Ways : But a certain Stupidity of Soul, with-
out Defire of Good, or Gonfcience of Evil, had en-
tirely overwhelmed me, and I was all that the mod
hardned, unthinking, wicked Creature among our
common Sailors can be fuppos'd to be, not having
the lead Senfe, either of the Fear of God in Dan*
ger, or of Thankfulnefs to God in Deliverances.

In the relating what is already paft of my Story,
this will be the more eafily believed, when I {hall
add, that thro' all the Variety of Miferies that
had to this Day befallen me, I never had fo much
as one Thought of it being the Hand of God, or
that it was a juft Punifiiment for my Sin, my re*
bellious Behaviour again ft my Father, or my pre-
fent Sins which were gtfeat j orfo much as aPuniih-
ment for the general Courfe of my wicked Life.
When I was on the ddpei ate Expedition on the de-
fert Shores of Africa^ X never had fo much as one
Thought of what would become of me * or one
Wifh to God to direft me whither I ftiould go, or to
keep me from the Danger which apparently fur-
rounded me, as well from voracious Creatures as
cruel Savages : But I was meerly thoughtlefs of a
God, or a Providences afted like % meer Brute
from the Principles of Nature, and by the Di&ates
pf common Scnfe only, and indeed hardly that.



[ *°4 ]



When I wasdeliver'd and taken up at Sea by the
Portugal Captain, well us'd, and dealt juftly and
honourably with, as well as charitably, I had not
the leaft Thankfulnefs on my Thoughts : When
again I was fhipwreck'd, ruin'd, and in danger of
drowning on this Ifland, I was as far from Re-
morfe, or looking on it as a Judgment 5 I only faid
to my felf often, that I was an unfortunate Dog 9 and
born to be always miferablc.

It is true, when I got on Shore firft here, and
found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and my
felf fpar'd, I was furpriz'd with a kind of Extafy,
andfomeTranfports of Soul, which, had the Grace
of God aflifted, might have come up to true Thank-
fulnefs; but it ended where it begun, in a meer
common Flight of Joy, or, as I may fay, being glad I
was alive, without the leaft Refle&ion upon the
diftinguiftiing Goodnete of the Hand which had
preferv'd me, and had fingled me out to be pre-
ierv'd, when all the reft were deftroy'd : or an En-
quiry why Providence nad been thus merciful to
me j even juft the fame common fort of Joy which
Seamen generally have after they are got fafe afhore
from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the next
Bowl of Punch, and forget almoft as foon as it is
oven and all the reft of my Life was like it.

Even, when I was afterwards, on due Confide-
ration, made fenfible of my Condition, how I was
caft on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of
humane Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Profped
of Redemption, as foon as I faw but a Profpeft of
living, and that I ihould not ftarve and perifh for
Hunger, all the Senfe of my Aflli&ion wore off,
and 1 begun to be very eafy, apply'd myfelf to the
Works propqr for my Prefemtion and Supply, and
was far enough from being affii&ed at my Con-
dition, as a Judgment; ftopa Heaven, or as the

Hand



[ »°5 ]



Hand of God againft mc y thefc were Thoughts
which very feldom enter'd into my Head.
- The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in
my Journal, had at firft fome little Influence upon
me, and began to afFe<5fc me with Serioufneft, &
long as I thought it had fomething miraculous in
its but as foon as ever that part of the Thought
was remov'd, all the Impreffion which was ras'd
from it, wore off alfo, as 1 have noted already.

Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be
more terrible in its Nature, or more immediately
dire£Hng to the invifible Power, which alone di-
re£ts fuch things 5 yet no foonerwas the firft Fright,
over, but the Impreffion it had made Went off alfo-
I had no more Senfe of God or his Judgments,
much lefs of the prefent Affli&ion of toy Circum-
fiances being from his Hand, than if I had been in
themoft profperous Condition of Life.

But now when I began to be fick, and a leifure*
ly View of the Miferies of Death came to place it-
felf before me % when my Spirits began to fink un-
der the Burden of a ftrong Diftemper, and Nattrfe
was exhaufted with the Violence of *the Fever J
Confcience that had flept fo loiag, beguttto 4 Wake,
and [ began to reproach myfelfwith my paft Life,
in which I had fo evidently, by uncommon Wk>
kednefs, provok'd the Juftice of God to lay me
under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in
fo vindi&ive a manner. - • • f

Thefe Refle&ions opprefs'd me for the fecond or
third Day of my Diftemper, and in the Violence,
as well of the Fever, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Confcience, extorted fome Words from me^
, like praying to G<bd, tho* I cannot fay they were
either a Prayer attended with Defies or with
Hopes 5 it was rather the Voice of mere Fright
and Diftrefsj my Thoughts were confus'd, the

Con-



L I06 J

Convi&ions great upon my Mind, and the Horror
of dying in fuch a miferable Condition rais'd Va-
pours into my Head with the mere Apprehenfi-
ons* and in thefe Hurries of my Soul, I know not
what my Tongue might exprefsj but it was ra-
ther Exclamation, fuch as, Lord! what a miferable
Creature am I? If I Jbould be ftck, IJball certainly
die for want of Help, and what will become of me /
Then the Tears bur ft out of my Eyes, and I could
fay no more for a good while.

In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father
came to my Mind, and prefently his Prediction,
which I mentioned at the Beginning of this Story,
viz. Ttbat if I did take this foolijh Step, God would not
blefs me \ and I would have leifure hereafter to reflect
tfpon having negleSed bis Counfelj when there might be
none to affifi in my Recovery* Now, faid I aloud,
My dear Father's Words are come to pafe : God's
Juftice has overtaken me, and I have none to help
or hear me : I reje&ed the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Pofturc or Sta-
tion of Life, wherein I might have been happy and
cafy j but I would neither fee it myfelf, or learn
to know the Blefling of it from my Parents : 1 left
them to mourn over my Folly, and now 1 am left
to mourn under the Confequences of it. I refus'd
their Help and Affiftance who would have lifted me
into the World, and wou'd have made every thing
eafy to me, and now I have Difficulties to ftruggle
with, toojgreat for even Nature itfclf to fupport,
and no Affiftance, no Help, no Comfort, no Ad-
vice : Then I cry'd out, Lord be my Help, for lam
in great Diflrefc.

This was the firft Prayer, if I may call it fo,
that I had made for many Years; But I return to
my Journal.

[ IQ7 ]

June z8. Having been fomewhat rcfrefli'd with
the Sleep I had had, and the Fit being entirely
off, I got up 5 and tho* the Fright and Terror of
my Dream was very great, yet I confider'd, that
the Fit of the Ague wou'd return again the next
Day, and now was my Time to get fomething to
refrefh and fupport myfclf when I fhould be ill *
and the firft Thing I did, I fiU'd a large fquare
Gafe Bottle with Water, and fet it upon my Ta-
ble, in Reach of my Bed ; and to take off the chill
or aguiih Difpofitiori of the Water, I put about
a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mix'd
them together 5 then I got me a Piece of the
Goat's Flefh, and broil'd it on the Coals, but
could eat very little * I walk'd about, but was very
weak, and withal very fad and heavy-hearted in
the Senfe of my miferablc Condition $ dreading
the Return of my Diftemper the next Day j at
Night I made my Supper of three of the Turtle's
Eggs, which I roafted in the Afhes, aftd eat, as wfc
call it, in the Shell > and this, was the firft Bit of
Meat I -had ever ask'd God's Bleflitig to, even as I
cou'd remember in toy whole Life.

After I had eaten, I try'd to Walk, but foufit!
myfelf fo weak that I cou'd hardly carry thfc
Gun, (for I never went out without that 5) fo I
went but a little Way$ and fat down upon the
Ground,- looking out upon the Sea, which was
juft before me, and very calm and fmooth : As I
fat here, fome fttch Thoughts as thefe occur'd to
me.

What is this Earth and Sea of Which I have leen
fo much, whence is it produe'd, and what am 1, and
all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane and
brutal, whence are we ?

Sure



L i<* J

Sure we are all made by fome fecret Power,
who form'd the Earth and Sea, the Air and Skyj
and who is that ?

Then it follow'd moft naturally, It is God that
has made it all : Well, but then it came on ftrangely,
if God has made all thefe Things, lie guides and
governs them all, and all Things that concern
them j for the Pawer that could make all Things,
mud certainly have Power to guide and dire&
them.

If fo, nothing can happen in the great Circuit
of his Works, either without his Knowledge or
Appointment.

And if nothing happens without his Knowledge,
he knows that I am here, and am in this dreadful
Condition j and if nothing happens without his
Appointment, he has appointed all this to befal
me.

Nothing occur'd to my Thought to contradi£t
any of thefe Conclufions* and therefore it refted
upon me with the greater Force, that it muft needs
f)e, that God had appointed all this to befal me;
that 1 was brought to this miferable Circumftance
by his Dire£tion, he having the fole Power, not of
me only, but of eyery Thing that happened in the
World. Immediately it follow'd,

Why has God done this to me ? What have I done
to be thus us'd ?

My Confcience prefently checked me in that En-
quiry, as if I had blafphem'd , and methought it
fpoke to me like a Voice; WREfCH! doft thou
Orsk what thou bafi done ! look back upon a dreadful
$nif-lbent Life, , and ask thy felf 'what thou hafi not
flow? ask, Why is it that thou inert not long ago de-
fined? Why ivert thou not drown' d in Yarmouth
Roads ? KilVd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by
tl?e Salle Man of War ? Devoured by the wildBeafts

m the Coaft of Africa? Or Drowtfd HERE,
when all the Crew perffid but thyfelf? Doft thou
ask, What have I done ? ' l ■• '

I was (truck dumb with tbefe Reflexions, as ohb
aftonifh'd, and had not a Word to fay, no Apt
to anfwer to myfelf, but rofe up penfive and fad,*
walk'd back to my Retreat, arid went up over my'
Wall, as if I had been going- to Bed j but my :
Thoughts were fadly difturb'd* artd I had i^o in-
clination to deep y fo I fat down in; my Ghaiiy
and lighted my Lamp, for it began to be dark:*
Now as the Apprehenfion of theReturnof my Di-
ftemper terrify'd me very much, it occur'd toftfy
Thought, that the Brafilians take no Phyfick but
their Tobacco for alrnoft all Diftempers* and I
had a: Piece of a Roll of Tobacco in one of thp
Chefts, which was quite cur'd, and fome alfo that 1
Was green and not quite cur'd. s .. \

I went$ directed by Heaven t\6 dofubtj for iii
this Cheft I found a Cure both for Soul and*Body $
I open'd the CHeft, and found what I looked for, vi&:
the Tobacco $ and as the few Books, I had fav ? d, r
lay there too, I took out one of the Bibles which
I mention'd before, and which to this Time I had
not found Leifure, or fo much as Inclination id
look into , I fay, I took it out, and brought both
that and the Tobacco with me to the Table.

What Ufe to make of the Tobacco, I knew not,
as to my Di (temper, or whether it was good for it
or no 5 but I try'd feveral Experiments with it, as
if I was refolv'd it ihould hit one Way or other :
1 firft took a Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my
Mouth, which indeed at firft almbfl ftupify'd toy
Brain, the Tobacco being green and ftrong, and
that I had not been much us'd to it; then I took
fome and fteep'd it an Hour or two in fome Rum,
and refolv'd to take a Dofe of it when I lay down y



L 11U J

and laftly, I burnt Tome upon a Pan of Coals, and
held my Nofe clofe over the Smoke of it as long as
I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almoft for
Suffocation.

In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the
Bible and began to read, but my Head was too
much difturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading,
at lead that Time * only having open'd the Book
cafually, the firft Words that occur'd to me were
thefe, Call on me in the Day of Trouble, and I will
deliver ', and tboufbalt glorify me.

The Words were very apt to my Cafe, and made
fomc Impreflion upon my Thoughts at the Time of
reading them, tho' not fo much as they did after-
wards 3 for as for being delivered, the Word had no
Sound, as Imayfay 9 to me \ theThing was fo remote,
(b impolfible in my Apprehenfion of Things, that
I began to fay as the Children of Ifrael did, when
they were promised Flcfh to eat, Can God fpread a
fable in the Wildernefs ? fo I began to fay, Can God
himfclf deliver me from this Place? and as it was
not for many Years that any Hope appeared, this
prevailed very often upon my Thoughts: But
however, the Words made a great Impreflion upon
me, and 1 mufed upon them very often. It grew
now late, and the Tobacco had, as I faid, doz'd
my Head fo much, that I inclined to fleep $ fo I
left my Lamp burning in the Cave, left I fhould
want any Thing in the Night, and went to Bed*
but before I lay down, I did what I never had done
in all my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God
to fulfil the Promife to me, that if I call'd upon him
in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me $ af-
ter my broken and im per fed Prayer was over, I
drunk the Rum in which I had fteep'd the Tobac-
co, which wasfo ftrongand rank of the Tobacco,
that indeed I could fcarce get it down * immediately

upon



[■'"I ]



upon this I went to Bed, I found prefently it flew
up in my Head violently, but I fell into a found
Sleep, and wak'd no more, till by the Sun it muflt
neceffarily be near three a-Clock in the Afternoon
the next Day -, nay, to this Hour I'm partly of the
Opinion, that I flept all the next Day and Night,
and till almoft three that Day after* for aflier-
wife i knew not how I fhould lofe a Day out of my
Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appearki
fome Years after I had done 5 For if I had loft it by
eroding and recroffing the Line, I fhould have loft
more than one Day : But certainly I loft a Day in
my Account, and never knew which Way.

Be that however one way or t'other, when I
awak'd I found myfelf exceedingly refrefh'd, and
my Spirits lively and cheerful 5 when I got up, I
was ftronger than I was the Day before, and my.
Stomach better, for I was hungry 5 and in fhort, I
had no Fit the next Day, but continued much al*
ter'd for the better ; this was the 29th.

The 50th was my Well-day of courfe, and I
went abroad with my Gun, but did not care to
travel too fan I kill'd a Sea-Fowl or two, fome-
thing like a Brand- Go ofe, and brought them home,
but was not very forward to cat them * fo I eat fome
more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good :
This Evening I renew'd the Medicine which I had
fupjaos'd did megood the day before, viz. theTobac •
co fteep'd in Rum, only I did not take fo much as
before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold my
Head over the Smoke j however, I was not fo well
the next Day, which was the firft of July, as I hop'd
I fhould have been *, for I had a little Spice of the
cold Fit, but it was not much.

July z. I renew'd the Medicine all the three
Ways, and dox'd my felf with it as it firft j and
doubled the Quantity which I drank*

V I



L 11Z J

5. I mifs'd the Fit for good and all, tho* I did
not recover my full Strength for fome Weeks after :
While I was thus gathering Strength, my Thoughts
run exceedingly upon this Scripture, I will deliver
thee j and the Impoffibility of my Deliverance lay
much upon my Mind in Bar of my ever expe&ing*
it: But as I was difcouraging myfelf with fuch
Thoughts, it occurred to my Mind, that I pored
fo much upon my Deliverance from the main Affli-
ction, that I difregarded the Deliverance I had re-,
cciv'd j and I was, as it were, made to ask my
felf fuch Queftions as thefe, viz. Have I not been
deliver'd, and wonderfully too, from Sicknefs? from
the moft diftrefled Condition that could be, and
that was fo frightful to me, and what Notice
had I taken of it? Had I done my part, God had de-
livered me 5 but I had not glorified him j that is to fay,
I had not own'd and been thankful for that as a
Deliverance, and how could I exped greater De-
liverance?

This touch'd my Heart very much, and imme-
diately I kneel'd down, and gave God Thanks a-
loud tor my Recovery from my Sicknefi.

July 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and be-
ginning at the New Teitament, I began ferioufly
to read it, and impos'd upon myfelf to read a-
while every Morning and every Night, not tying
myfelf to the Number of Chapters, but as long as
my Thoughts fliould engage me : It was not long
after I fet ferioufly to this Work, but I found
my .Heart more deeply and fincerely afFe&ed with
the Wickednefs of my paft Life : The Im-
preffion of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, All
thefe things have not. brought thee to Repentance^ ran
ferioufly in my Thought : I was earneftly begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happened
providentially the very Day that reading the Scrip-
; ture,



r »3]



ture, I came to thefe Words, He is exalted a Prince
and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and to give Remiffi*
on. I threw down the Book, and with my Heart
as well as my Hands lifted up to Heaven, in a
Kind of Extafy of Joy, I cry'd out- aloud, Jefus,
thou Son of David, Jefus, thou exalted Prince and
Saviour, give me Repentance!

This was the firftTime that I could fay, in the
true Senfe of the Words, that I pray'd in all my Life *
for now I pray'd with a Senfe of my Condition,
and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded
on the Encouragement of the Word of God > and
from this Time, I may fay, I began to have Hope
that God would hear me.

Now I began to conftrue the Words mentioned
above, Call on me, and I will deliver you, in a diffe-
rent Senfe from what I had ever done before $ for
then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd De-
liverance, but my being dehver'd from the Capti-
vity I was in $ for tho* I was indeed at large
in the Place, yet the Ifland was certainly a
Prifon to me, and that in the word Senfe in the
World > but now I learn'd to take it in another
Senfe : Now I look'd back upon my paft Life wirh
fuch Horror, and my Sins appear'd fo dreadful,
that my Soul fought nothing of God, but Delive-
rance from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my
Comfort: As for my folitary Lifp it was nothing 5
I did not fo much as pray to be tleliver'd from it,
or think of it 3 it was all of no Confideration in
Companion to this* And I add this Part here, to
hint to whoever fhall read it, that whenever they
come to a true Senfe of things, they will find De-
liverance from Sin a much greater Bleffing, than De-
liverance from Affli&ion.

But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal.

My Condition began now to be, tho* not lefs mi-
ferable as to my Way of living, yet much eafier
to my Mind * and my Thoughts being dire£ted,by
a conftant reading the Scripture and praying to
God, to things of a higher Nature > I had a great
deal of Comfort within, which till now I knew no-
thing of j alfo,as my Health and Strength returned,
I beftir'd myfelf to furnifh myfelf with every thing
that I wanted, and make my Way of living as re-
gular as I could*

From the 4th of July to the 14th, I was chiefly
employed in walking about with my Gun in my
Hand, a little and a little at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of
Sicknefs: For it is hardly to be imagined, how low
I was, and to what Weaknefs I was reduced. The
Application which I made Ufe of was perfectly
new, and perhaps what had never cur'd an Ague
before, neither can I recommend it to any one to>
pra&ife, by this Experiment > and tho* it did carry
ofFthe Fit, yet it rather contributed to weakening
me y for 1 had frequent Convulfions in my Nerve*
and Limbs for fome Time.

I learnt from it alfo this in particular* that be-
ing abroad in the rainy Seafon was the moil pernici-
ous thing to my Health that could be, efpecially in
thofe Rains which came attended with Storms and
Hurricanes of Wind $ for as the Rain which came
in the dry Seafon was always moft accompanyVi
with fuch Storms, fo I found that Rain was much
more dangerous than the Rain which fell in Sep-
tember and QEtober.

I had been now in this unhappy Ifland almoft 10
Months, all Poflibility of Deliverance from this
Condition feem'd to be entirely taken from me*
and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had
ever fet Foot upon that Place : Having now fecur'd

my



[ "5]



my Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind, I
had a great Defire to make a more pcrfcd Difco-
very of the Jfland, and to fee what other Produc-
tions I might find, which I yet knew nothing
of.

It was the 1 f th of July that I began to take a
more particular Survey of the Iflandit felf: I went
up the Creek firft, where, as I hinted, I brought
my Rafts on Shore > I found after I came about
two Miles up, that the Tide did not flow any
higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very frefh and good $
but this being the dry Seafon, there was hardly any
Water in fome Parts of it, at leaft, not enough to
run in any Stream, fo as it could be perfceiv'd.

On the Bank of this Brook I found many plea-
fant Savana'Sj or Meadows, plain, fmooth, and
cover'd with Grafs 5 and on the rifing Parts of
them next to the higher Grounds, where the Wa-
ter, as it might be fuppofed, never overflow'd,
I found a great deal of Tobacco, green and growing
to a great and very ftrong Stalk * there were di-
vers other Plants which I had no Notion of, or Un-
derftanding about, and might perhaps have Vir-
tues of their own, which I could not find out.

I fearched for the CaJJava Root, which the /»-
dians in all that Climate make their Bread of,but I
could find none. I faw large Plants of Aloes, but
did not then underftand them. I faw feveral Sugar
Canes, but wild, and for want of Cultivation, im-
perfect. I contented myfelf with thefe Difcoveries
for this Time, and came back mufing with my
felf what Courfw I might take to know the Virtue
and Goodneis of any of the Fruits or Plants which
1 fhould d.fcovcrj but could bring it to no Con-
cluhiMj ior in fhort, I had made fo little Obler-
vation while I was in the Brafils y that I knew little

1 z of



[ II* ]



of the Plants in the Field, at leaft very little that
might ferve me to any Purpofe now in my Dif-
trefs.

The next Day, the itfth, I went up the fame
Way again, and after going fomething farther thad
I had gone the Day before, I found, the Brook, and
the Savana's began to ceafe, and the Country be-
came more woody than before > in this Part I found
different Fruits, and particularly I found Melons
upon the Ground in great Abundance > and Grapes
upon the Trees j the Vines had fpread indeed over
the Trees, and the Clutters of Grapes were jufl:
now in their Prime, very ripe and rich: This was a
furprifing Difcovery, and I was exceeding glad of
them 5 but I was warn'd by my Experience to eat
fparingly of them, remembring, that when I was
afhorein Barbary^ the eating of Grapes kill'dfeveral
of our Englifi Men who were Slaves there, by
throwing them into Fluxes and Fevers: But I
found an excellent Ufe for the Grapes, and that
was to cure or dry them in the' Sun, and keep
them as dry'd Grapes or Raifins are kept, which
1 thought would be, as indeed they were, as
wholefomc as agreeable to eat, when no Grapes
could be had.

I fpent all that Evening there, and went not
back to my Habitation, which by the way was
the firft Night, as I might fay, I had lain from
Home. In the Night I took my fixit Contrivance,
and got up into a Tree, where I flept well, and the
next Morning proceeded upon my Difcovery, tra-
velling near four Miles, as I might judge by the
length of the Valley, keeping dill due North, with
a Ridge of Hills on the South, and Eaft fide of
me.

At the End of this March I came to an Open-
ing, where the Country feem'd to detcend to the

Weft,



j.



[ "7 3



Weft, and a little Spring of frefh Water, which if-
fued out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the
other way, that is due Eaft > and the Country ap-
pear'd fo frefh, fo green, fo flourifhing, every thing
being in a con ftant Verdure, or Flourifti of Springy
that it look'd like a planted Garden.

I defcended a little on the Side of that delicious
Vale, furveying it with a fecret Kind of Pleafure,
(tho' mixt with my other affli£ting Thoughts) to
think that this was all my own, that I was King
and Lord of all this Country indefcafibly, and
had a Right of PofTeflion j and if I couid convey it,
I might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as
any Lord of a Manor in England. I faw here
Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Le-
mon, and Citron Trees , but all wild, and very
few bearing any Fruit, at leait not then : Howe-
ver the green Limes that I gathered, were not
only pleaiimt to ear, but very wholefome 5 and I
mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water, which
made it very wholefome, and very cool, and re-
frefhing.

I found now I had Bufinefs enough to gather and
carry Home* and 1 refolv'd to lay up a Store, as
well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnifh
mvielf for the wet Scafon, which I knew was ap-
proaching.

In order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of
Grapes in one Place, and a lefler Heap in another
Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons in
another Place $ and taking a few of each with me,
I travell'd homeward, and refolv'd to come again,
and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make to
carry the reft Home.

Accordingly, having fpent three Days in this
Journey, I came Home* fo I mull now call my
Tent and my Cave : But before I got thither, the

I 3 Grapes



[ n8 ]



Grapes were fpoil'd , the Richncfs of the Fruits,
and the Weight of the Juice having broken them,
and bruis'd them, they were good for little or no-
thing > as to the Limes they were good, but I
could bring but a few.

The next Day, being the ipth, I went back,
having made me two fmall Bags to bring Home
my Harveit: But I was furpriz'd, when coming
to my Heap of Grapes, which were fo rich and
fine when I gathered them, I found them all fpread
about, trod to Pieces, and drag'd about, fomc
here, fome there, and Abundance eaten and de^
vour'd : By this I concluded, there were fome wild
Creatures thereabouts, which had done this 5 but
what they were I knew not.

However, as I found that there was no laying
them up on Heaps, and no carrying them aw ay in
a Sack, but that one Way they would be deltroy'd,
and the other way they would be crufh'd with
their own Weight, I took another Courfe > for I
gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung
them up upon the out Branches of the Trees, that
they might cure and dry in the Sun 5 and as for
the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as many back as
I could well ftand under.

When I came Home from this Journey 5 I con*
templated with great Pleafure the Fruittulnefs of
that Valley, and the Plealantnefs of the Situation
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water,
and the Wood, and concluded, that I had pitch'cj
upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far
the worit Part of the Country. Upon the whole
1 began to confider of removing my Habitation ;
and to look out for a Place equally fafe, as where
I now was fituate, if pofliblc, in that pleafant
fruitful Part of the I Hand.

S Thi>



[ **9 1



This Thought run Jong in my Head, and I was

exceeding fond of it for iome Time, the Pleafant-
nefs of the Place tempting me; but when I came
to a nearer View of it, and to confider that I was
now by the Sea- Side, where it was at lead pofliblc
that fomething might happen to my Advantage,
and by the fame ill Fate that brought me hither,
might bring fome other unhappy Wretches to the
fame Place $ and tho' it was fcarce probable that
any fuch Thing fhould ever happen, yet to enclofe
my felf among the Hills and Woods, in the Center
of the Jfland, was to anticipate my Bondage, and
to render fuch an Affair not only improbable, but
impoffible j and that therefore I ought not by any
Means to remove.

However, I was fo enamoured of this Place,
that I fpent much of my Time there for the
whole remaining Part of the Month of July, and
tho' upon fecond Thoughts I refolv'd as above, not
to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a Bower,
and furrounded it at a Diftance with a ftrong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could
reach, well ftak'd, and fill'd between with Brujh-
wood > and here I lay very fecure, fometimes two
or three Nights together, always going over ic
with a Ladder, as before j fo that I fancy'd now I
had my Country Houfe, and my Sea-Coalt-Houfe:
And this Work took me up to the Beginning of
Auguft.

1 had but newly finifh'd my Fence, and began
to enjoy my Labour, when the Rains came on, and
made me ftick clofe to my firft Habitation \ for tho*
I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece
of a Sail, and fpread it very well j yet 1 had not
the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms, nor
a Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains
were extraordinary.

I 4 AJytftfL



[ iso ]



About the beginning of Auguft, as 1 /aid, I had
finifh'd my. Bower, and began to enjoy myfelf.
The third of Auguft y I found the Grapes I had
hung up were perfectly dry'd, and, indeed, were
excellent good Raifins of the Sun ; fo I began to
take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that I did (oy for the Rains which followed
would have fpoiPd them, and I had loft the beft
Part of my Winter Food -, for I had above two
hundred large Bunches of them. No fooner had
I taken them all down, and carry'd mod of them
Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and from
hence, which was the fourteenth oiAuguft^ it rain'd
more or left, every Day, till the middle of October \
and fometimes fo violently, that I could not ftir out
of my Cave for feveral Days.

In this Seafon I was much furpriz'd with the
Increafe of my Family 5 1 had been concern'd for
the Lofs of one of my Cats, who run away from
me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no
more Tale or Tidings of her, till to my Aftonifh-
ment fhe came Home about the End of Auguft %
with three Kittens. This was the more ftrange to
me, becaufe tho' I had kill'd a wild Car, as I
call'd it, with my Gun* yet I thought it was a
quite differing Kind from our European Cats* yet
the young Cats were the fame Kind of Houfe breed
like the old one* and both my Cats being Female s,
I thought it very ftrange: But from thefe three
Cats, I afterwards came to be lb pefter'd with Cats,
that 1 was fore'd to kill them like Vermin, or wild
Beafts, and to drive them from my Houfe as much
as poflible.

From the fourteenth of Auguft to the twenty
fixth was inceflant Rain, fo that I could not ftir,and
was now very careful not to be much wet. In this
Confinement I began to be ftraitned for Food, but

venturing



r 121 1



venturing out twice, I one Day kilPd a Goat, and
the laft Day, which was the twenty fixth, found
a very large Tortoife, which was a Treat to roe,
and my Food was regulated thus $ I eat a Bunch of
Raifins for my Breakfaft, a Piece of the Goat's Flefli,
or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd 5 for to my
great Misfortune, I had no Veflel to boil or ftew
any Thing j and two or three of the Turtle's Eggs
for my Supper.

During thisConfinement in my Cover by the Rain,
I work'd daily two or three Hours at enlarging my
Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on towards one Side,
till I came to the Outfide of the Hill, and made
a Door or Way out, which came beyond my Fence
or Wall, and fo I came in and out this Way ; but I
was not perfectly eafy at lying fo open 5 for as I
had manag'd myfelf before, I was in a perfeffc En-
clofure, whereas now I thought I lay expos'd, and
open for any Thing to come in upon me 3 and yet
I could not perceive that there was any living
Thing to fear, the biggeft Creature that I had yec
feen upon the Ifland being a Goat.

September the thirtieth, I was now come to the
unhappy Anniverfary of my Landing. I caft up the
Notches on my Poft, and found I had been on
Shore three hundred and fixty five Days. I kept
this Day as a Solemn Faft, fetting it apart to Re-
ligious Exercife, proftrating myfelf on the Ground
with the mofl ferious Humiliation, confeffing my
Sins to God, acknowledging his Righteous Judg-
ments upon me, and praying to him to have Mer*
cy on me, through Jejus Chrift; and having not
tailed the leaft Refreshment for twelve Hours,
even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat
a Bisket Cake, and a Bunch of Grapes, and went
to Bed, finiihmg the Day as I began it.

I had



[ 122 ]



I bad all this Time obferv'd no Sabbath-Day *
for as at firft I had no Senfe of Religion upon my
Mind, I had after fome Time omitted to diftin-
guiih the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than
ordinary for the Sabbath-Day, and fo did not really
know what any of the Days were j but now having
cad up the Days, as above, I found I had been
there a Year * fo I divided it into Weeks, and fet
apart every feventh Day for a Sabbath * though I
found at the End of my Account 1 had loft a Day
or two in my Reckoning.

A little after this my Ink began to fail me, and
fo I contented myfelf to ufe it more fparingly, and
to write down only the mod remarkable Events of
my Life, without continuing a daily Memorandum
of other Things.

The rainy Seafon, and the dry Seafon, began now
to appear regular to me, and I learnt to divide
them fo, as to provide for themaccordingly. But
I bought all my Experience before I had it* and
this I am going to relate, was one of the molt dif«
couraging Experiments that I made at all. I have
mention'd that I had fav'd the few Ears of Barley
and Rice, which I had fo furprizingly found fpring
up, as I thought, of themfelvcs, and believe there
were about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twenty
of Barley » and now I thought it a proper Time
to fow it after the Rains, the Sun being in its
Southern Pofition going from me.

Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well
as I could with my wooden Spade, and dividing it
into two Parts, I fow'd my Grain j but as I was
lowing, it cafually occur'd to my Thoughts, that
I would not fow it all at firft, becaufe I did not
know when was the proper Time for it 5 fo I fow'd
about two Thirds of the Seed, leaving about 4
handful of each.

It



[ I2 3 ]



It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that
I did fo, for not one Grain of that I fow'd this
Time came to any Thing $ for the dry Months
following, the Earth having had no Rain after the
Seed was fown, it had no Moifture to afTift its
Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet
Seafon had come again, and then it grew as if it
had been but newly fown.

Finding my firft Seed did not grow, which I
eafily imagin'd was by the Drought, I fought for
a moifter Piece of Ground to make another Trial
in, and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new
Bower, and fow'd the reft of my Seed in February^
a little before the Vernal Equinox 5 and this having
the rainy Months of March and April to water it,
fprung up very plcafantly, and yielded a very good
Crop j but having Part of the Seed left only, and
not daring to fow all that I had, I had but a fmall
Quantity at laft, my whole Crop not amounting
to above half a Peck of each kind.

But by this Experiment I was made Matter of
my Bufinefs, and knew exa&ly when the proper
Seafon was to fow; and that I might expe& two
Seed Times, and two Harvefts every Year.

While this Corn was growing, I made a little
Pifcovery which was of Ufe to me afterwards ; As
foon as the Rains were over, and the Weather be-
gan to fettle, which was about the Month of A r 0-
vember^ I made a Vifit up the Country to my Bow-
er, where though I had not been fome Months, yet
I found all Things juft as I left them. The Cir-
cle or double Hedge that I had made, was not on-
ly firm and entire $ but the Stakes which I had cut
out of fome Trees that grew thereabouts, were all
fhot out and grown with long Branches, as much
as a Willow*Tree ufually Ihoots the firit Year after
lopping its Head, 1 could not tell what Tree to

call



[ »24 ]



call it, that thcfc Stakes were cut from. I was
furpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to fee the
young Trees grow; and I prun'd them, and led
them up to grow as much alike as I could $ and it
is fcarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew
into in three Years j fo that though the Hedge
made a Circle of about twenty five Yards in Dia-
meter, yet the Trees, for fuch I might now call
them, loon covered it> and it was a compleat
Shade, fufficient to lodge under all the dry Seafon.

This made me refolve to cut fome more Stakes,
and make me a Hedge like this in a Semicircle
round my Wall* I mean that of my firft Dwel-
ling, which I did j and placing the Trees or Stakes
in a double Row, at about eight Yards diftance
from my firft Fence, they grew prefently, and
were at firft a fine Cover to my Habitation, and
afterward ferv'd for a Defence alfo, as I fhall ob-
fervc in its Order.

I found now, That the Seafons of the Yeaj
might generally be divided, not into Summer and
Winter y as in Europe j but into the Rainy Seafons,
and the Dry Seafons, which were generally thus :

The Rainy Seafon fometimcs held longer or
fhorter, as the Winds happened to blow 5 but this
was the general Obfervation I made : After I had
found, by Experience, the ill Confequence of being
abroad in the Rain, I took care t6 furniih myfelf
with Provifions beforehand, that I might not be
oblig'd to go out ; and I fat within Doors as much
as poffible during the wet Months.

In this Time I found much Employment, (and
apry fuitable alfo to the Time) for I found great
^UccaGon of many Things which I had no way to
furnifh myfelf with, but by hard Labour and con-
ftant Applications particularly, I try'd many Ways
to make myfelf a Basket, but all thc Twigs I
could get for the Purpofe prov'd fo brittle, that
they would do nothing. It prov'd of excellent 'Ad-
vantage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I
ufed to take great Delight in Handing at a Basket-
maker's in the Town where my Father liv'd, to
fee them make their JVicker-ware -, and being, as
Boys ufually are, very officious to help, and a
great Obferver of the Manner how they work'd
thofe Things, and fometimes lending a Hand, I
had by this Means full Knowledge of the Methods
of it, that I wanted nothing but the Materials*
when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of
that Tree from whence I Cut my Stakes that grew,

s might



C 12* ]



might poffibly be as tough as the Sallows*, and
Willows, and Often in England, and I refolv'd
to try.

Accordingly the next Day I went to my Coun-
try-Houfe, as I call'd it, and cutting fome of the
fmaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpofe as
much as I could defire j whereupon I came the next
Time prepar'd with a Hatchet to cut down a
Quantity, which 1 foon found, for there was great
Plenty of them 5 thefe I fet up to dry within my
Circle or Hedge, and when they were fit for Ufe,
I carried them to my Cave, and here during the
next Seafon I employed my felf in making, as well
as I could, a great many Baskets, both to carry
Earth* or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had
occafion. And tho' I did not finifh them very hand-
Ibmly, yet I made them fufficiently ferviceable for
my Purpofe y and thus afterwards I took Care ne-
ver to be without them > and as my dicker-ware
decay'd, I made more, efpecially, I made ftrong
deep Baskets to place my Corn in, inftead of Sacks,
when I (hould come to have any Quantity of it.

Having maiter'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a
World of Time about it, I beitir'd myfelf to fee
if poffible how to fupply two Wants: I had no
Veflels to hold any Thing that was Liquid, ex-
cept two Runlets which were almoit full of Rum,
and fome Glafs Bottles, fome of the common Size,
and others which were Cafe- Bottles fquare, for
the holding of Waters, Spirits, &c. I had not fo
much as a Pot to boil any Thing, except a great
Kettle, which I fav'd out of the Ship, and which
Was too big for fuch Ufc &s I deiir'd it, viz. to
make Broth, and ilew a Bit of Meat by it felf.
The Second Thing I would fain have had, was a
Tobacco-Pipc ) but it was impoffible to me to

y make



[ I2 7 ]



make one, however I found a Contrivance for that
too at laft.

I em ploy 'd myfelf in Planting my Second Rows
of Stakes or Piles, and in this fffcker-working all the
Summer, or dry Seafon, when another Bufinefe
took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd
I could fpare,

I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to
fee the whole Ifland, and that I had travelled up
the Brook, and fo on to where I built my Bower*
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on
the other Side of the Ifland. I now refolv'd to
travel quite crofs to the Sea-Shore on that Side *
fo taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog, and
a larger Quantity of Powder and Shot than ufual,
with two Bisket Cakes, and a great Bunch of
Raifins in my Pouch for my Score, I began my
Journey. When I had pafs'd the Vale where my
Bower flood as above, I came within View of the
Sea, to the fVeftjznd it being a very clear Day, I fairly
defcry'd Land, whether an Ifland or a Continent, I
could not tell j but it lay very high, extending from
the tVefl to the IV. S. IV. at a very great Diftancej
by my Guefs it could not be lefs than Fifteen or
Twenty Leagues off.

I could not tell what Part of the World this
mi^ht be, otherwife than that I knew it muft be
part of America, and as I concluded by all my
Obfervations, muft be near the Spanijh Dominions,
and perhaps was all inhabited by Savages, where
if I fhould have landed, I had been in a worfc
Condition than I was now 5 and therefore I acqui-
efced in the Difpofitiqps of Providence, which I
began now to own, and to believe, order'd every
Thing for the beft j I fay, I quieted my Mind with
this, and left afHi&ing myfelf with fruitlefs Wiihes
of being there.

Befidcs



[ 128 ]



Befides, after fome Paufc upon this Affair, I
confider'd, that if this Land was the Spanijh Coaft,
I fliould certainly, one Time or other, fee fome
Veflel pafs or re-pafs one Way or other 5 but if
not* then it was the Savage Coaft between the
Spanijh Country and BrafiJs^ which are indeed the
worft of Savages ; for they are Cannibals, or Men-
caters, and fail not to murthcr and devour all the
humane Bodies that fall into their Hands.

With thefe Confiderations I walk'd very leifurc-
ly forward. I found that Side of the Ifland where
I now was, much pleafanter than mine, the open
or Savana Fields fweet, adorn'd with Flowers and
Grafs, and full of very fine Woods. I faw Abun-
dance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught one,
if poflible to have kept it to be tame, and taught
it to fpeak to me. I did, after fome Pains taking,
catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd it down with
a Stick, and having recover'd it, I brought it home $
but it was fome Years before I could make him
fpeak : However, at laft I taught him to call me
by my Name very familiarly: But the Accident
that follow'd, tho' it be a Trifle, will be very di-
verting in its Place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey : I
found in the low Grounds Hares, as I thought
them to be, and Foxes, but they differed greatly
from all the other Kinds I had met with •, nor could
I fatisfy myfelf to eat them, tho' I kill'd feveral :
But I had no need to be venturous 5 for I had no
Want of Food, and of that which was very good
too 5 efpecially thefe three Sons, viz. Goats, Pid-
geons,and Turtle or Tortoife j which, added to my
Grapes, Leaden-hall Market could not have fur-
niih'd a Table better than I, in Proportion to the
Company $ and tho* my Cafe was deplorable
enough, yet I had great Caufe for Thankfulneft,

and



r
tft.



C 129 ]



that I was not driven to any Extremities for Food j
but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.

I never traveled in this Journey above two Miles
outright in a Day, or thereabouts; but I took^fo
many Turns and Returns, to fee what Difcovenes
I could make, that I came weary enough to the
Place where I refolved to fit down for all Night 5
and then I either repos'd myfelf in a Tree, or fur-
rounded myfelf with a Row of Stakes fet upright
in the Ground, either from one Tree to another,
or fo as no wild Creature could come at me, with-
out waking me.

As Toon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was fur-
prized to fee that I had taken up my Lot on the
wbrft fide of the Ifland ; for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas oil
the other fide I had found but three in a Year and
half. Here was alfo an infinite number of Fowls,
of many Kinds, fome which I had feen, and fome
which I had not feen of before, and many of them
very good Meat-, but fuch as I knew not the
Names of, except thofe call'd Penguins,

I could haVe {hot as many as I pleas'd, but was
very fparing of my Powder and Shot; and therefore
had more Mind to kill a She-Goat, if I could,
which I could better feed on; and though there
were many Goats here more than on my Side the
Ifland, yet it was with much more Difficulty that
I could come near them, the Country being flat
and even, and they fow me much fooner than when
I was on the Hill.

: I confefs this Side of the Country was much
pleafanter than mine, but yet I had not the leaft In-
clination to remove; for as I was fix'd in my Ha-
bitation, it became natural to me, and I feem'd all
tha while I was here, to be as it were upon a Jour-
ney, and from Home : However, I tjravcll'd along

K the



[ 13° ]



the Shore of the Sea, towards the EaJI, I fuppofe
about twelve Miles ; and then fetting up a great
Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded I
would go home again > and that the next Journey
I took Ihould be on the other Side of the Ifland,
Eafi from my Dwelling, and fo round till I came
to my Poft again : Of which in its Place.

I took another Way to come back than that I
went, thinking I could eafily keep all the Ifland fo
much in my View, that I could not mifs finding
my firft Dwelling by viewing the Country $ but I
found myfelf miftaken* for being come about two
or three Miles, I found my felf defcended into a
very large Valley* but fo furrounded with Hills,
and thofe HiJls covered with Wood, that I could
not fee which was my Way by any Dire&ion but
that of the Sun, nor even then, unlefs I knew very
well the Pofition of the Sun at that Time of the
Day.

It happened to my farther Misfortune, That the
Weather prov'd hazey for three or four Days,
while I was in this Valley j and not being able to
fee the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably,
and at lad was obliged to find out the Sea Side,
look for my Poft, and come back the fame Way I
went*; and then by eafy Journeys I turn'd Home-
ward, the Weather being exceeding hot, and my
Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things
very heavy.

In this Journey my Dog furpriz'd a young Kid,
and feiz'd upon it, and I running in to take hold
of it, caught it, andfav'd it alive from the Dog:
I had a great mind to bring it home if I could *
fori had often been mufing, Whether it might not
be poffible to get a Kid or two, and fo raife a Breed
of tame Goats, which might fupply me when my
Powder and Shot ihould be all fpent.

I

I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with
a String which I made of fome Rope- Yarn, which
I always carry'd about me, I led him along, tho*
with fome Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and
there I enclos'd him, and left him % for 1 was very
impatient to be at home, from whence I had been
abfent above a Month.

I cannot exprefs what a Satisfaftion it was to
me, to come into my old Hutch, and lye down in
my Hamock-Bed : This little wandring Journey^
without fettled Place of Abode, had been fo un-
pleafant to me, that my own Houfe, as I call'd it
to my felf, was a perfedfc Settlement to me, com^
par'd to that 5 and it rendered every thing about
me fo comfortable, that I refolv'd I would never
go a great way from it again, while it fhould be
my Lot to ftay on the I {land,

I repos'd my felf here a Week, to reft and regale
my felf after my long Journey > during which, moft
of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair of
making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be
a mere Domeftick, and to be mighty well acquain-
ted with me. Then I began to think of the poor
Kid , which I had penn'd in within my little Cir-
cle, and refolv'd to go and fetch it home, or give
it fome Food j accordingly I went, and found it
where I left it ; for indeed it could not get out, but
was almoft ftarv'd for want of Food. . I went and
cut Bows of Trees , and Branches of fuch Shrubs
as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed
it, I ty'd it as I did before to lead it away $ but it
was fo tame with being hungty, that I bad no need
to have ty'd it > for it tollow'd me like a Dog $ and
as I continually fed it, the Creature became fo
loving, fo gentle, and lb fond , that it was from
that Time one of my Domefttcks alfo, and would
never leave me afterwards.

K * The



[ '3 2 ]



The rainy Seafon of the Autumnal Equinox was
now come, and [kept the 30th of September in the
fame folcmn manner as before, being the Anniver-
fary of my Landing on the Ifland, having now been
there two Years, and no more Prof^eft of being de-
livered than the firft Day I came there. I fpent the
whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledg-
ments of the many wonderful Mercies which my So-
litary Condition was attended with, and without
which it might have been infinitely more miferable.
1 gave humble and hearty Thanks that God had
been pleated to difcover to me, even that it was
poflible I might be more happy in this Solitary
Condition, than I fhould have been in a Liberty of
Society, and in all the Pleafures of the World. That
He could fully make up to me the Deficiencies of
my Solitary State, and the want of Humane So-
ciety, by his Prefence, and the Communications of
his Grace to my Soul, fupporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon his Providence
here, and hope for his eternal Prefence hereafter.

It was now that I began fenfibly to feel how
much more happy this Life I now led was, with
all its miferable Circumftances, than the wicked,
curfed, abominable Life I led all the paft Part of
my Days* and now I changed both my Sorrows
and my Joys* my very Defires alter'd, my Affedfci-
ons changed their Gufts, and my Delights were
perfe&ly new, from what they were at my firft
Coming, or indeed for the two Years paft.

Before, as I walk'd about either on my Hunt-
ing, or for viewing the Country, the Anguifh of
my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon
me on a fudden, and my very Heart would die
within me, to think of the Woods, the Mountains,
the Defarts I was in j and how I was a Prifoner
lock'd up with the eternal Bars and Bolts of the

s fc Ocean,



{''33 ]



Ocean, in an uninhabited Wildernefs, without Re-
demption : In the midft of thegreateftCompofures
of my Mind, this would break out upon me like a
Storm, and make me wring my Hands, and weep
like a Child : Sometimes it would take me in the
middle of my Work, and I would immediately fie
down and figh, and look upon the Ground for anr
Hour or two together $ and this was ftill worfe to
me j for if I could burft out into Tears, or vent
my felf by Words, it would go off, and the Grief
having exhaufted it felf, would abate.

But now I began to exercife my felf with new
Thoughts; I daily read the Word of God, and ap-
ply'd all the Comforts of it to my prefent State.
One Morning being very fad , I open'd the Bible
upon thefe Words, 1 "will never ^ never leave thee^
norforfake thee ; immediately it occurr'd, That thefe
Words were tome, Why elfefhould theybedireft-
cd in fuch a Manner, juft at the Moment when I
was mourning over my Condition, as one forfaken
of God and Man? Well then, faid 1, if God does
not forfake me, of what ill Confequence ckn it be,
or what matters it, though the World fhouhd all
forfake me, feeing on the other hand, if I had all
the World, and mould lofe the Favour and.Blef-
fing of God, there would be no Comparifon in
the Lofs ?

From this Moment I began to, conclude in my
Mind, That it was poflible for me to be more
happy in this forfaken Solitary Condition, than it
was probable 1 fhould ever have been in any other

Particular State in the World j and \vijth this
'houghc I was going to give Thanks to God for
bringing me to this Place.

I know not what it was, but fomethingfhock'd
my Mind at that Thought, and I durft not fpeak
the Words : How canit thou be fuch a Hypocrite,

K 5 (faid



[ *3+ ]



((aid I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for
a Condition, which however thou may'ft endea-
vour to be contented with , thou would'ft rather
pray heartily to be delivered from j fo I ftopp'd
there : But though I could not fay, I thank'd God
for being there $ yet I finccrcly gave Thanks to
God for opening my Eyes , by whatever affli&ing
Providences, to fee the former Condition of my
Life, and to mourn for my Wickednefs, and repent.
I never open'd the Bible, or (hut it, but my very
Soul within me blefs'd God for direfting my Friend
in England^ without any Order of mine, to pack it
up among my Goods $ and for affifting me after*
wards to fave it out of the Wreck of the Ship.

Thus, and in this Difpofition of Mind, I began
my third Year $ and tho' I have not given the Rea-
der the Trouble of fo particular Account of my
Works this Year as the firft $ yet in general it
may be obferv'd , That I was very feldom idle y
but having regularly divided my Time, according
to the feveral daily Employments that were before
me, fuch as, Fir ft, my Duty to God, and the Read*
ing the Scriptures, which I conftantly fet apart
fome Time for thrice every Day. Secondly ! , The go-
ing abroad with my Gun for Food, which generally
took me up three Hours in every Morning, when
it did not rain, 'Thirdly ', The ordering, curing,
preferring, and cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd
for my Supply $ thefe took up great Part of the
Day : Alfo it is to be confidered that the middle of
the Day, when the Sun was in the Zenith, the Vio-
lence of the Heat was too great to ftir out ; fo that
about four Hours in the Evening was all the Tijne
I could be fuppos'd to work in, with this Excep-
tion, That fometimes I changed my Hours of
Hunting and Working, and went to work in the

Morning



r m ]



Morning, and abroad with my Gun in the After*
noon.

To this fhort Time allowed for Labour, I defire
may be added the exceeding Laborioufnefs of my
Work 5 the many Hours which for want of Tools,
want of Help, and want of Skill; every Thing I
did, took up out of my Time. For example, I
was full two and forty Days making me a Board for
a long Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave $ where-
as two Sawyers with their Tools, and a Saw- Pit,
would have cut fix of them out of the fame Tree
in half a Day.

My Cafe was this : It was to be a large Tree,
which was to be cut down, becaufe my Board was
to be a broad one. . This Tree I was three Days
a cutting down, and two more cutting off the
Bows, and reducing it to a Log or Piece of Tim-
ber. With inexpreflible hacking and hewing I
redue'd both the Sides of it into Chips , till it be-
gun to be light enough to move 3 then I turn'd it,
and made one Side of it fmooth and flat as a
Board, from End to End $ then turning that fide
downward , cut the other Side , till I brought the
Plank to be about three Inches thick, and fmooth
on both Sides. Any one may judge the Labour of
my Hands in fuch a piece of Work $ but Labour
and Patience carry'd me through that and many
other things : I only obferve this in particular, to
{hew the Reafon why fb much of my Time went
away with fo little Work, viz. That what might be
a little to be done with Help and Tools, was a vaft
Labour, add required a prodigious Time to do alone,
and by hand.

But dot with Handing this, with Patience and La-
bour I went through many things j and indeed eve-
ry thing that my Circumftances made neceflary to
&e to do, as will appear by what follows.

K4 I was



I i3« J

I was now, in the Months of November and De-
eember^ expc£Hng my Crop of Barley and Rice.
The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them
Was not great ; for as 1 obferv'd, my Seed of each
Was not above the Quantity of half a Peck s
for I had loft one whole Crop by fowing in the
dry Seafon 5 but now my Crop promis'd very well,
When on a fudden I found I was in danger of lo-
sing it all again by Enemies of feveral Sorts* which
it was fcarce poffible to keep from it \ as Firft, the
Goats, and wild Creatures which I calPd Hares,
who tailing the Swectnefs of the Blade, lay in it
Night and Day, as foon as it came up, and eat it
focLfc, that it could get no Time to (hoot up into
Stalk.

This Ifaw no Remedy for, but by making an En-
clofure about it with a Hedge, which I did with a
great deal of Toil; and the more, becaufe it re*
quir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land was
but fmall, fuited to my Crop, I got it totally well
fene'd, in about three Weeks Time 5 and (hooting
fome of the Creatures in the Day- time, I fet my
Dog to guard it in the Night, tying him up to a
Stake at the Gate, where he would ftand and bark
all Night long -, fo in a little time the Enemies for-
fook the Place, and the Corn grew very ftrong, and
well, and began to ripen apace.

But as the Beads ruined me before, while my
Corn was in the Blade 5 fo the Birds were as likely
to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear * for go-
ing along by the Place to fee how it throve, 1 (aw
my little Crop furrounded with Fowls of I know
not how many forts, who ftood as it were watch-
ing till I (hould be gone : 1 immediately let fly a-
mong them (for I always had my Gun with me)
I had no fooner (hot but there rofe up a little

Cloud

[ *37 ]



Cloud of Fowls, which I had not fecn at all, from
among the Corn it felf.

This touch'd me fenfibly, for I forefaw, that in
a few Days they would devour all my Hopes, that I
fhould be ftarv'd, and never be able to raife a Crop
at all, and what to do 1 could not tell : However,
I refolv'd not to lofe my Corn, if poffible, tho' I
fhould watch it Night and Day. In the firft
Place, I went among it to fee what Damage was
already done, and found they had fpoiPd a good
deal of it, but that as it was yet too green for
them, theLofs was not fo great, but that the Re-
mainder was like to be a good Crop if it could be
fav'd.

I {laid by it to load my Gun, and then coming
away I could eafily fee the Thieves fitting upon all
the Trees about me, as if they only waited till I
was gone away, and the Event proved it to be fo j
foraslwalk'd off as if I was gone, I was no fooner
out of their Sight, but they dropt down one by
one into the Corn again. I was fo provok'd that I
could not have Patience to ftay till more came on,
knowing that every Grain that they eat now, was,
as it might befaid^ a Peck-loaf to me in the Confe-
quence * but coming up to the Hedge, I fir'd again,
and kilPd three of them. This was what I wifh'd
for ; fo I took them up, and ferv'd them as we
ferve notorious Thieves in England (viz.) hangM
them in Chains for a Terror to others. It is imr
poffible to imagine almoft, that this fhould have fuch
an Effe6fc as it had j for the Fowls wou'd not only
not come at the Corn, but in fhort they forfook all
that Part of the Ifland, and I could never fee a Bird
pear the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung
rixere.

This



[ i 3 8]



This I was very glad of, you may be fure, and a-
bout the latter end of December, which was our fe-
cond Harvcft of the Year, 1 reap'd myCrop.

I was fadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sickle to
cut it down, and all I could do was to make one as
well as I could out of one of the broad Swords
or Cutlafles, which 1 fav'd among the Arms out of
the Ship. However,as my firft Crop was but fmall,
I had no great Difficulty to cut it down j in ihort,
I reap'd it my way, for I cut nothing off but the
Ears, and carry'd it away in a great Basket which
I had made, and fo rubb'd it out with my Hands;
and at the End of all my Harvefting, I found that
out of my half Peck of Seed, I had near two Buftiels
of Rice, and above two Bulhels and half of Barley,
that is to fay, by my Guefs, for I had no Meafure
at that - time.

However, th is was a great Encouragement tb me $
and I forefaw that in time, it would pleafe God
to fiipply me with Bread : And yet here I was per-
plex'd again, for I neither knew how to grind or
make Meal of my Corn, or indeed how to clean it
and part it $ nor if made into Meal, how to make
Bread of it* and if how to make it, yet I knew
not how to bake it : thefe things being added to my
Defirc of having a good Quantity of Store, and to
fecure a conftant Supply, I refolv'd not to tafte any
of this Crop, but to preferve it all for Seed againlt
the next Seafon, and in the mean time to employ
all my Study and Hours of Working to accomplifti
this great Work of Providing my felf with Corn
and Bread.

It might be truly faid, that now I work'd for
my Bread : 'tis a little wonderful, and what I be-
lieve.few People have thought much upon, {viz.) the
ft range multitude of little Things neceffary in the

Pro*



[ *39 ]



Providing, Producing, Curing, Drefling, Making
and Finifhing this one Article of Bread.

I that was reduced to a mere State of Nature,
found this to my daily Difcouragemenr, and was
made more and more fenfible of it every Hour, even
after I had got the firft Handful of Seed-Corn,
which, as I have faid, came up unexpectedly, and
indeed to a furprize.

Firft, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no
Spade or Shovel to dig it. Well, this I conquered,
by making a wooden Spade, as I obferv'd before $
but this did my Work but in a wooden manner, and
tho' it coft me a great many Days to make it, yet
for want of Iron it not only wore out the fooner,
but made my Work the harder, and made it be per-
formed much worfe.

However, this I bore with, and was content to
work it out with Patience, and bear with the bad-
nefs of the Performance. When the Corn was fow'd,
I had no Harrow, but was forced to go over it my
felf, and drag a great heavy Bough of a Tree ovef
it, to Scratch it, as it may be call'd, rather than
Rake or Harrow it.

When it was growing and grown , I have ob-
fcrv'd already, how many Things I wanted, to
Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure and
Carry it home, Thrafh, Part it from the Chaff,
and Save it. Then I wanted a Mill to Grind it, ,
Sieves to Drefs it, Yeaft and Sale to make it into
Bread, and an Oven to bake it * and yet all thefe
things I did without, as fhall be obfetVd $ and
yet the Corn was an ineftimable Comfort and Ad-
vantage to me too. All this, as I faid, made
every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that
there was no help for , neither was my Time fo
much Lofs to me, becaufe as I bad divided it , ft
pertain Part of it was every Day. appointed to

thefe



[ 14.0 ]

thefe Works; and as I rcfolv'd to ufe none* of the
Corn for Bread till I had a greater Quantity by
me, I had the next fix Months to apply my fclf
wholly by Labour and Invention to furnifh my
felf with Utenfils proper for the performing all the
Operations neceflary for the making the Corn
(when I had it) fit for my ufe.

But firft, I was to prepare more Land, for X
had now Seed enough to fow above an Acre of
Ground. Before 1 did this, I had a Weeks-work
at lead to make me a Spade, which when it was
done was but a forry one indeed, and very heavy,
and requir'd double Labour to work with it $
however I went thro' that, and fow'd my Seed in
two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near my
Houfe as I could find them to my Mind, and
fene'd them in with a good Hedge, the Stakes of
which were all ctit of that Wood which I had fet
before, and knew it would grow, fo that in one
Year's time I knew I fhould have a Quick or Liv-
ing-Hedge, that would want but little Repair.
This Work was not fo little as to take me up lefs
than three Months, becaufe great Part of that
time was of the wet Seafori, when I could not go
abroad.

Within Doors, that is, when it rained, and I
could not go out, I found Employment on the fol-
lowing Occafions 5 always obferving, that all the
while I was at work I diverted my felf with talk-
ing to my Parrot, and teaching him to fpeak*
and I quickly learn'd him to know his own Name,
and at laft to fpeak it out pretty loud, POLL,
which was the firft Word I eyer heard fpoken in
the Ifland by any Mouth but my own. This
therefore was not my Work, butan affiftant to my
Work 5 for now, as Ifaid, -I had a great Employ-,
ment upoq my Hands, as follows, (viz.) 1 had

long ftudy'd, by fome Means or other, to make
my felf fome Earthen Veflels, which indeed I
wanted forely, but knew not where to come at
them : However, confidering the Heat of the Cli-
mate, I did not doubt but it I could find out any
fuch Clay, I might botch up fome fuch Pot, as
might, being dry'd in the Sun, be hard enough,
and ftrong enough to bear handling, and to hold
any Thing that was dry, and requir'd to be kept
foj and as this was neceflary in the preparing
Corn, Meal, &c. which was the Thing I was up-
on, I refolv'd to make fome as large as I could,
and fit only to (land like Jarrs to hold what ihould
be put into them.

It would make the Reader pity me, or rather
laugh at me, to tell how many awkward Ways I
took to raife this Pafte, what odd mifhapen ugly
things I made, how many of thci^P fell in, and how
many fell out, the Clay not being (tiff enough to
bear its own Weight* how many crack'd by the
over violent Heat of the Sun, being fet out too
haftilyj and how many fell in pieces with only re-
moving, as well before as after they were dry'd;
and in a word, how after having laboured hard
to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it, to bring
it home and work it 5 I could not make above two
large earthen ugly things, I cannot call them Jarrs,
in about two Months Labour.

However, as the Sun bak'd thefe two very dry
ancj hard, I lifted them very gently up, and fet
them down again in two great Wicker -Baskets,
which 1 had made on purpofc for them, that they
might not breaks and as between the Pot and the
Basket there was a little room to fpare, I ftuff'd it
full of the Rice and Barley Straw, and thefe two
Pots being to (land always dry, I thought would

- hold



r 142 ]



1



hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, when
the Corn was bruifed.

Tho' I ipifcarried fo much in my Defign for
large Pots, yet I made feveral (mailer things with
better Succefs * fuch as little round pots, flat Dilhes,
Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand
turn'd to , and the Heat of the Sun bak'd them
ftrangely hard.

But all this would not anfwer my End, which
was to get an Earthen Pot to hold what was Li*
quid, and bear the Fire, which none of thefe could
do. It happened after fome time, making a pretty
JargeFire for cooking my Meat, when Fwent to
ut it out after I haddone with it, I found a bro-
en Piece of one of my Earthen- ware Veflels in the
Fire, burnt as hard as a Stone, and red as a Tile.
I was agreeably furpriz'd to fee it, and faid to my
fclf, that certainly they might be made to burn
whole, if they would burn broken.

This fet me to ftudying how to order my
Fire, fo as to make it burn me fomc'Pots. I had
no notion of a Kiln, fuch as the Potters burn
in, or of glazing them with Lead, tho' I had fome
Lead to do it with ; but I plac'd three large Pip-
kins, and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon ano-
ther, and plac'd my Fire- wood all round it, with
a great Heap of Embers under them j I ply'd the
Fire with frefli Fuel round the out-fide, and upon
the top, till I faw the Pots in the infide red hot
quite thro*, and obferv'd that they did not crack
at all > when I faw them clear red, I let them ftand
in that Heat about f or 6 Hours, till I found one
of them, tho' it did not crack, did melt or run * for
the Sand which was mixed with the Clay melted
by the violence of the Heat, and would have run
into Glafs if I had gone on 5 fo I flack'd my Fire
gradually, till the Pots began to abate of the red

Colour

Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might
jpot let the Fire gbate too feft j in the Morning I
had three very good, I will not fay handfome Pip-
kins } and two other Earthen Pots,, as hard burnt
a& cou'd be defir'd $ and one of them perfectly
gWd with the running of the Sand.'

After this Experiment, I need not fay that I
wanted no fort of Earthen Ware for my Ufe 5 but
I muft needs fay, as to the Shapes of them, they
were very indifferent, as any one may fuppofe,
when I had no way of making them; but as the
Children make Dirt- Pies, or a$a Woman would
makes Pies that q<?ver learn'd to raife Paftq.

No Joy at a Thing of fo mean a Nature was
ever equal to mine, when I found I had made an
Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire * and I had
hardly Patience to ftay till they were cold, before
I fet one upon the Fire again, with fome Water in
it, to boil me fome Meat, which it did admirably
well 5 and with a piece of a Kid I made fome very
good Broth, though I wanted Oatmeal, and fevc-
ral other Ingredients requifite to make it fo good
as I would have had it been.

My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mor-
tar to ftarap or beat fome Corn in > for as to the
Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Per-
fection of Art, with one pair of Hands. To fup-
ply this Want I was at a great Lofs j for o£ all
Trades in the World I was as perfeftly unqualified
for a Stone- Cutter, as for any whatever j neither
had I any Tools to go about it with. I fpent many
a Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut
hollow, and make fit for a Mortar, and could
find none at all, except what was in the folid Rock,
and which I had no way to dig or cut out 5 nor in-
deed were the Rocks in the Wand of Hardnefs firf-
ficient, but Were all of a fandy crumbling Stone,

which



[ H4 ]



which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy
Peftle, or would break the Corn without filling it
with Sand 5 fo after a great deal of Time loft in
fearching for a Stone, I gave it over, and refolv'd
to look out for a great Block of hard Wood, which
I found indeed much eafier 5 and getting one as big
as I had Strength to ftir, I rounded it, and form'd
it in the Outude with my Axe and Hatchet, and
then with the Help of Fire, and infinite Labour,
made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in Brafil
make their Canoes. After this, I made a great hea-
vy Peftleor Beater, of the Wood called the Iron-
Wood, and this I prepared and laid by againft I had
my next Crop of Corn, when I proposed to my felf
to grind, or rather pound my Corn into Meal to
make my Bread.

My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or
Searfc, to drefs my Meal, and to part it from the
Bran and the Husk, without which I did not fee
it poflible I could have any Bread. This was a
mod difficult thing, fo much as but to think on;
for to be fure I had nothing like the neceflary
Thing to make it 5 I mean fine thin Canvas, or
Stuff to fearfe the Meal through. And here I
was at a full Stop for many Months j nor did I real-
ly know what to do 5 Linen I had none left, but
what was meer Rags> I had Goat's Hair, but nei-
ther knew I how to weave it, or fpin it ; and had I
known how, here were no Tools to work it with j
all the Remedy that I found for this, was, That at
laft I did remember I had among the Seamens
Cloaths which were fav'd out of the Ship, fome
Ncckcloaths of Callicoe or Muflin * and with fome
Pieces of thefe I made three fmall Sieves, but pro-
per enough for the Work > and thus I made fhift
-tor fome Years* how I did afterwards, J fhall
fhcw in its Place.

confider'd, and how Ifhould make Bread wfrcfrl
came to have Corn ; forfirftl had no Yeafli;' as'to
that Part, as there was no fupplying the Want, fo I
did not concern my felf much abbtit it : But for in
Oven, I was indeed in great Pain 5 at length I found
out an Experiment for that alfo, which was( this ;
I made fame earthen Veflels very broad, but rtbt
deep; that is to fay, about two Foot Diameter,
and not above nine Inches deep 5 thtfte i 'burnt' in
the Fire, as I had done the other, arid : laid them
by } and when I wanted to biake^ Ihiade a great
Fire upon my Hearth, which I hadpav'd wiehfpme f
fquare Tiles of my own making, and burning aUo $
but I fhould not call them fquare. w

When the Fire- wood Was burnt pretry ; much in-
to Embers, or live Coals, I drew them fofwarc?
upon this Hearth, fo as to cover it i\\ over, and there
I let them lie, till the Hearth was- very hot; thert
fweeping away all the Embers, I fet down my Loaf,
or Loaves, and whelming dbym the earthen Pot
upon them, drew the Embers all round the Outrfidd
of the Pot, to keep inj and add to the Heat; and
thus, as well as in the beft Oven in the World, I
bak'd my Batley Loaves, and became in little Time
a meer Pattry-Cook into the Bargain ; for I made
my felf feveral Cakes of thie Rice, and Puddings j
indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any Thing to
put into them, fuppofing I had, except the FTefh
either Fowls or Goats.

It need not be wonder'd at, if all thdc Things
took me up moft Part of the third Year of my A-
bode here ; for it is to be obferv'd, That in the In*
tervalsof thefe Things, I had my newHarveftand
Husbandry to manage 5 for I reap'd toy Corn in its
Seafoh, and earned it Home as well as* I could, and
laid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets,- till I had

L Time



1 14*]



Time to rub it out > for I had no Floor to thrafh it
on, or Inftrument to thraihit with.

And now indeed mv Stock of Corn increafirig,
I really wanted to build my Barns bigger : I wanted
a Place to lay it up in * for the Increafe of the Corn
now yielded me io much, that I had of the Barley
about twenty Buihels, and of the Rice as much,
or more 5 inibmuch, that now I refolv'd to begin
to ufc it freely 5 for my Bread had been quite gone
a great while » alfo I refolv'd to fee what Quanti-
ty would be fufficient for me a whole Year, and to
tow but once a Year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bufhels
of Barley and Rice was much more than I could
confume in a Year j fo I refolv'd to fow juft the
feme Quantity every Year that I fowed thelaft, in
hopes that fuch a Quantity would fully provide me
With Bread, fciV.,

All the while tbefe Things were doing, you may
be fure my Thoughts run many times upori .the
Profpeft of Land which I had feen from the other
Side of the Ifland, and I was not without fecret
Wifhes that I were on Shore there, fancying the
feeing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country.
I might find fome Way or other to convey my
(elf tart her, and perhaps at laft find fome Means
of Efcape.

Bat all this while I made no Allowance for the
t)angers of fuch a Condition, and how I might fall
into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps fuch 9s I
might hpve Rcafon to think far worfe than the Li-
on? and Tigers of /ffrjea. That if I once cairie in-
to their Powpr, 1 fhould Tun a timid ibore than a
Thqu&nd to One of beingjcilTd, and perhaps ofbe-

C&ribem Coafts were Canipibals or Man-eaters % and

from that Shore. That fuppofc tkcy werenot Gam"*
bals, yet th^jt tjhey'might kill me, as many Europeans
who had fallen into fttbtir Hands had been ferv'd,
even when (they had been xen or twenty together *
much more I that was but one, and could make lit-
tle or no Defence. All J&efe Things, I fay, w&ch I
ought to have confider'id well of, anddid,<9ft#pia
my Thoughts afterwards, yet took up none of jpy
Apprebenfions atfirft; but my Head run mightily
upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore.

Now I wifli'd for my Boy Xury y and the Longr
Boat, with the Shoulder of Mutton Sail, mxh
-which i f^U'd above a thoufand Miles on the Coaft
of Africk * but this was in vain. Then I thought \
would go and Joqk at our Ship's Boat, which, as J
have feid, was Mown up upon the Shore a great
Way Jn the Storm, when we were firftcaft away.
She layalmoft whqreihe did at firft, but not quite ^
and was turn'd by the Force of the Waves and thp
Winds, .aimed Bottom upward, againft % high
Ridge of Beachy rough Sand > but no Water a-
bout her as before.

If I had had Hands to have refitted her, aqd',tp
have bunph'd her into the Water, the Boat would
have jdone well .enough, and 1 might have .gone
back into the -&^///i with her eafily enough $ but
I might have fordeen, that I could no more tprn
.her, and fet her upright upon her Bottom, than 'I
could remove the Ifland: However, Iwenttorije
Woods, and mt Levers and Rollers, and brought
[them to the Boat, rcfolv'dto try what I could do j
'foggeftiog to my felf, that if I could but turn her
down, I might eafily repair the Damage ihe bad
rreceiv'd) and ihe would be a very good Boat, and
I might go to Sea in her .very eafily .

bout it} atlaft finding it impoffibletolieavcit up
with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the
Sand to undermine it, and fo to make it fall down,
fetting Pieces of Wood tothruft and guide it right
in the Fall. : _

But when I had done this, I was unable to ftir it
up again, or to get under it, much lefs to move it
forward towards the Water 5 fo I was fore'd to give
it over 5 and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of
the Boat, my defire to venture over for the Main
increafed, rather than decreafed, as the Means for
it feem'd impoffible.

This at length put me upon thinking, Whether
it was not poflible to make my felf a Canoe , or Peria-
gua 9 fuch as the Natives of thofe Climates make,eveh
without Tools, or^ as I might fay, without Hands,
wz.'of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not
only thought poflible, but eafy, and pleas'd my felf
etftreamly with the Thoughts of making it^ and
with my having much more Convenience for it than
any of the Negroes or Indians $ but not at all confi-
dering the particular Inconveniences which I lay
under, more than the Indians did, viz. Want of
Hands to move it, when it was made, into the
Water 5 a Difficulty much harder for me to fur-
mbiint, than all the Confequences of want of
Tools could be to them : For what was it to me,
That when I had chofen a vaft Tree in the Woods,
I might with much Trouble cut it down, if after
I might be able with my Tools to hew and dub
the Out-fide into the proper Shape of a Boat, and
burn or cut out the Infide to make it hollow, fo
to make a Boat of it, if .after all this, I muft leave
it juft there where I found it, and was not able to
launch ix into the Water.

fiance, while I was making this Boat; but I (hould
have immediately thought how I fhould get it into
the Sea } but my Thoughts were fo intent upon my
Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once confi-
der'd how L fhould get it off of the Land ; and it
was really in its own Nature more cafy for me to
guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than about
forty five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to fet it a
float in the Water.

I went to work upon this Boat the mod like a
Fool that ever Man did, who had any of his Senfes
awake. I pleas'd my felf with the Defign, with-
out determining whether, I was ever able to under-
take. it* not hut that the Difficulty of launching
my Boat came often into my Head* but I put a
flop to my own Enquiries into it, by this foolifh
Anfwer which I gave my felf, Let 9 s fir ft make it, Nl
warrant Fttfindfome way or other to get it atorig^ when
'tis done.

* This was a moll prepofterous Method -, but the
Eagernefs of my Fancy prevailed, and to work I
went: • I fclPd a Cedar Tree : I queftion much
whether Solomon ever had fiich a one for the Build-
ing of the Tetaple at Jerufalem. It was five Foot
ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the
Stump, and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at
the End of twenty two Foot* after which it lef-
fen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches :
It was not without infinite Labour that I fell'd
this Tree : I was twenty Days hacking and hew-
ing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more get-
ting the Branches and Limbs, and the vaft fprcad-
ing Head of it cut off, which I hack'd am] hew'd
through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpreffible
Labour : After this, it coil me a Month to fhape
it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to fomething
Jike the Bottom of a Boat, that it might iwim up

right sis it ought to do. It coft roe near three
Months more to clear the Infide, and work it out
fo 9 as to make an exad Boat of it : This I did in-
deed without Fire, by rticer Mallet and Chiflel, and
by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought it
to be a very handfome Periagua, and big enough to
have carried fix and twenty Men, and confequently
bis enough to have carried me and all my Cargo.

When I had gone through this Work, I was ex-
tremely delighted with it. The Boat was really
much Digger than I ever faw a Canoe^ or Periagua y
thit was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a
wedry Stroke it had coft, you may be fure * and
thete remained nothing but to get it into the Water )
and had I gotten it into the Water, I make no que*
ftibn, butl ihould have begun the maddeft Voyage,
and the mod unlikely to be performed, that ever
was undertaken.

But all my Devices to get it into the Water
fail'dme, though they coft me infinite Labotttoo.
It Iky about one hundred Yards from the Water,
atid not more : But the firft Inconvenience was, it
was up Hill towards the Creek \ well, to take a*
way this Difcourajgement, I refolv'd to dig into
the Surface of the Earth, and fo make a Declivity :
This I begun, and it coft me a prodigious deal of
Pains i but who grudge Pains, that have their
Deliverance in View ? But when this was work'd
through, and this Difficulty manag'd, it was (till
much at one j for I could no more ftir the Canoe^
than I could the other Boat.

Then I meafur'd the Diftance of Ground, and
refolv'd to cut a Dock, or Canal, touring the Wa-
ter up to the Csnoe^ feeing I could not bring the
Ctncc down to the Water: Well, I began this
Work, and when I began to enter into it, and cal-
culate how deep it was to be dug, how broad,

who



C is* 3

how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, that by
the number of Hands I had, being none but my
own, it muft have been ten or twelve Years before
ifhould have gone through with it} for the Shore
lay high, fo that at the upper End it muft have
been at leaft twenty Foot deep j fq at length, tha*
with great Relu&ancy, I gave this Attempt over
alfo.

This griev'd me heartily, and now I faw, tho f
too late, the Folly of beginning a Work before we
count the Coft, and before we judgp rightly of
our own Strength to go through 'with it.

In the middle of this Work, I finifh'd my fourth
Year in this Place, and kept fay Anniverfary with
the fame Devotion, and with as much Comfort as
ever before $ for by a conftant Study, and ferious
Application of the Word of God, arid by the Af-
fifiance of his Grace, I gain'd a different Know*
ledge from what I had before. I entertained diffe-
rent Notions of Things. I look'd now upon the
World as a Thing remote, which I had nothing tp
do with, no Expectation from, and indeed no E)c-
fires about : In a Word, I had nothing indeed to
do with it, nor was ever like to have 5 to I thought
it look'd as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter,
viz. as a Place I had lived in, but was come out of
it •, and well might I (ay, as Father Abraham to
Dives i Between me and thee is a great Gulph fixed.

In the firft Place, I was removed frorp all the
Wickednefs of the World here: I had neither the
Luft of the Flejh) the Lufi of the £ye 9 or the Pride of
Lsfe. I had nothing to covets for 1 had all that I
was now capable of enjoying : J was Lord of the
whole Manor ; or if I pleas'u, I might call my felf
King, or Emperor over the whole Country, which
1 had Pofleflion of. There were #b Rivals : I had
no Competitor, none to difputc Sovereignty or

L 4 Command



C 152 ]

Command with me. I might have rais'd Ship
Loadings of Corn $ but I had no ufe for it y fo I
let as little grow as I thought enough for my Oc-
cafion. I had Tortoife or Turtles enough > but
now and then one was as much as I could put to
any ufe. I. had Timber enough to have built a
Fleet of Ships. I had Grapes enough to have
made Wine, or to have cur'd into Raifins, to have
loaded that Fleet when they had been built.

But all I could make ufe of, was, All that was
valuable. I had enough to eat, and to fupply my
Wants; and, what was all the reft to me? If I
Jrill'd more Flefh than I could eat, the Dog muft
eat it, or the Vermin. If I fow'd more Corn than
I could cat, it muft be fpoil'd. The Trees that I
cut. down, were lying to rot on the Ground: I
could make no more ufe of them than for Fewel,
and that I had no Occafion for, but to drefs my
Food" .

In a Word , The Nature and Experience of
Things di£tated to me upon juft Rcfleftion, that
all the good Things of this World, are no farther
good to us, than they are for our Ufc y and that
whatever we may heap up indeed to give others,
we enjoy juft as much as we can ufe, and no more.
The moft covetous griping Mifer in the World
would have been cured of the Vice of Covetoufneft,
if he had been in my Cafe ; for I poflefled infinitely
more than I knew what to do with. I had no room
for Defire, except it was of Things which I had
not, and they were but Trifles, though indeed of
great ufe to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Par-
cel of Money, as well Gold as Silver, about thirty
fix Pounds Sterling : Alas ! there the nafty forry
ufelefs Stuff lay * I had no manner of Bufincfs
for it j and I often thought with myfelf, that I
would have given a tfaodfui of it for a Grofs of

Tobacco*



C *53 ]



Tobacco- Pipes, or For a Hand-Mill to grind ipy
Corn j nay, I would have given it all for Sixpenny-
worth of Turnip and Carrot Seed out of England, or
for a Handful of Peafe and Beans, and a Battle of
Ink : Js it was, I had not the leaft Advantage by at,
or Benefit from it j but there it lay in a Drawer,
and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave in
the wet Seafon -, and if I had had the Drawer full of
Diamonds, it had been the fame Cafe* and they
had been of no manner of Value to me, becaufe of
no Ufe.

I had now brought my State of Life to be much
eafier in it felf th?n it was at firft, and much eafiq:
to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently
fat down to my Meat with Thankfulnefs, and acf •
mired the Hand of God's Providence, which had
thus fpread my Table in the Wildernefs. I learned
to look more upon the bright fide of my Condi-
tion, and lefs upon the dark fide $ and to confider
what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted j and
this gave me fometimes fuch fecret Comforts, that
I cannot exprefc them > and which I take Notice
of here, to put thofe difcontented People in Mind
of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God
has given them , becaufe they fee, and covet tome-
thing that he has not given them: All our Difcon-
tents about what we want, appeared to me, to
fpring from the want of Thankfulhels for what we
have.

. Another Refle&ion was of great Ufe to me, and
doubtlefs would be fo to any one that fhould fall
into fuch Diftrefs as mine was* and this was, to
compare my prefent Condition with what I at firft
cxpe&ed it mould be j nay, with what it would
certainly have been, if the good Providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the Ship to be
$aft up nearer to the Shore, where I not only could



,\



[15+]



come at her, but could bring what I got out of
her to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort j
without which, I had wanted for Tools to work.
Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot
fpr getting my Food.

I Tpent whole Hours, I may fay whole Days, in
reprefenting to my felf in the molt lively Colours,
how I mutt have a&ed, if I had got nothing out
of the Ship 5 how I could not have fo much as
got any Food, except Fifh and Turtles; and that
as it was long before I found any of them, I muft
jbave perifh'd firft : That I fhould have liy'd, if I
]bad not perifhed, like a meer Savage : That if I
hgd kiird a Goar, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to flea or open them, or part theFlefh
from the Skin and the Bowels, or to cut it up *
but muft gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it with
my Qaws like a Bead.

Thefc Refleftions made me very fenfible of the
Qpodnefs of Providence to mc, and very thankful
for my prefent Condition, with all its Hardfliips
and Misfortunes : And this part alfo I cannot but
recommend to the Refie&ion of thofe, who are apt
in their Mifery, to fay, Is any Affliction like mine !
J^et them conuder, How much worfe the Cafes of
fome People are, and their Cafe might have been,
if Providence had thought fit.

I had another Reflection which aflifted me alio
to comfort my Mind with Hopes > and this was,
comparing my prefent Condition with what I had
deferv'd, and had therefore Rcafon to expeft from
the Hand of Providence, i had liv'd a dreadful
Life, perfe&ly deftitute of the Knowledge and Fear
of God. I had been well inftry&ed by Father and
Mother; neither had they been wanting to me, in
their early Endeavours, to infufe a religious Awe
of Cod into my Mind, a Senfc of my Duty, and

of



I »55 ]



of what the Nature and End of my Being required
of me. But alas ! falling early into the Sea- taring
Life, which of all the Lives is the moft deftituce
of the Fear of God, though his Terrors are al*
ways before them* I fay, falling early into the
Sea-faring Life, and into Sea-faring Company, all
that little Senfe of Religion which! had entertain*
«d, was laugh 'd out of me by my Mefi-Mates, by
a hardened defpifing of Dangers, and the Views of
Death, which grew habitual to me, by my long
Abfence from all manner of Opportunities to con*
verfe with any Thing but what was like my fel£
or to hear any Thing that was good, or tended
towards it.

So void was I of every Thing that was good} or
of the lead Senfe of what I was, or was to be,
that in the greateft Deliverances I enjoy'd, fucK
as my Efcape from SalU * my being taken up by
the Fortuguefe Mafter of the Ship \ my being plant-
ed fo well in the Brafils j my receiving the Cargo
from England, and the like j I never had once the
word Thank God fo much as on my Mind, or in
my Mouth * nor in the greatcft Diftrck had I Jp
much as a Thought to pray to him, or Co much as
to fay, Lord have mercy upon me $ no nor to men-
tion the Name of God, unlcfi it was to (wear by,
and blafpheme it.

I had terrible Reflexions upon my Mind for
many Months, as I have already obferv'd, on the
account of my wicked and hardotd Life pail j and
"When I looked about me, and confidered what parti*
culasr Providences had attended sic fincemy €oa-
ing into this Place, and how God had .dealt boun-

. With thefe Refle&ions I work'd my 'Mind u^,
not only to Refignation to the Will of God in* the
prefent Difpofition of my Clrcumftahces 5 but even
to a fincereTfiankfulnefsfor niy Condition j and that
I, who was ytt a living Maty* ought not to com-
. plain, feeing I had not the due Pumfhment of my
Sins j that I enjoy'd fo many Mercies which I had
n6 reafoa to havc r expe&cd in that Place* thatff
ought never more ; bo repine at my Condition, but to
Trjoice, and to give daily Thanks for that daily
Bread, which nothing but a cfoticTof Wonders could
have brought. That I ought to confider I had been
•ftjl even by aMiracle, even as great as that of feed-
ing Elijabbj Ravens; nay, by a long Series of Mi-
r4cles, J and that I- could hardly have nam'd a Place
iri the unhabitable part of the World where I could
have, been caft triore to my Advantage : A Place,
Vfrhere as I had no Society, which was my Affli-
ftion on one Hand, fo I found no ravenous Beads,
no fiirious Wolves or Tygers to threaten my Life,
no venomous Creatures or poiibnous, which I might
fteid on to my Hurt, no Savages to murder and de-
vour me.

In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one
way, fo jt was a Life of Mercy, another 5 and I
wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort, * but
to 1 be able to make my Sence of God's Goodnefs to
me, and Care over me in this Condition, be my
daily Confolation 5 and after I did make a juft
Improvement of thefe things, I went away and was
no more fad.

I had now been here fo long, that many^hings

My Qotthi began to decay too mightily : As to
Linnen, I had had none a good while, except lome
Chequered Shirts which I toond in the Chefts of the
Other Seamen, And which I carefully preferv'd, be*
cattfe many tiroes I could bear no other Cloaths on
btft a Shirt j and it was a very great help to me
that I had among dl the Men% Cloaths of the Ship
ahnoft three dozen of Shirts. There were aHb fe-
veral thick Watch-Goats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear *
and tho* it ft true, that the Weather was fo vio-
lent hot that there was no need of Cloaths, yet I
could not go quite naked | no, tho 9 1 had been in*



to it, which t wasmot, nor could not abide
theThonghls«rf it, tho* I was all alone.

The ftaffen wtar i could not go quite naked,
ires, I couH not bear the Heat of the Sun fo
well when quite naked, as with fome Cloaths on \
ttty, the veiy Heat frequently blifter'd my Skin*
Whereas with a Shirt on, the Air it (Mf made .fome
Motion, and whilftling under that Shirt was twofold
cooler than without it : No more could I ever bring
toy (elf to 'go out in thoHcatiof the Sun without a
Cap or a Hat > the Heat of the Sun beating wifh
fudi Violence as it does in that Place, would give
toe the Head-ach preiently, by darting fo dire&ly
on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on * fo that t
q&olanotbearit* whereas, if I put on my Hat, it
would prdbntfo jgo away.

Uponthc&wiewsl began to confider about put-
titfg eht'fewJRags I had, which I called Cloaths,
imo'fcme Order: I had worn out all the Waft*
coats I bad, and my /Bufinefe was now to try if*
€oidd not make Jackets out of the 'great Watch-
<Goats which \ had by me , and with fuch other
Materfcb as3 'tad* fo rtfetw worfc * Tayloring,
or rather indeed a Botching, for I made molt

pietous Work of it. However, I taade fhift; tb
make two or thtfee hew Waftcoats, which I hoped
Would ferve me a great while j as for Breeches or
Drawers, I made but a Very forty (hift indeed, till
afterward.

I have mentioned that I faved the Skins of all
the Creatures that I kill'd, I mean fotir-foofced one!?,
and I had hurtg them up ftretch'd out witfi Stiek*
in the Sun, by which means Tome of them were fo
dry and hard that thcV were fit for little, but othtirs
it fecms tfete very ufeful. The firft thlflg I mad*
6f tfiefe was a great Cap for my Head, wkft thfe
Hair on the Outfide to fhoor t>ff the Rairt* and
this I performed fo well, that after this I made tee.
a Suit of Cloaths wholly of thefe Skins, that is tfr
fay, a Waftcoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and
both Ioofe, for they were rather wanting to keep
trie cool than to keep me warm. I muft hot omit
to Acknowledge that they were \Metchedly made %
for if I Was a bad Carpenter ', I was a worte Taylor:
However, they toere Tuch as I haade very good
fhift With 5 and tohen I was abroad, if it happened
to rain, the Hair of tinfy Waftcoat -aftd Cap being
outcrtfitfft, I was kept vtty dry.

After this I fpent a great deal of Tiifte and Pains
fo'itnake me an tFmbrella* I was indeed in great
Want of one, and had a great mind to make oncj
I had feen them made in the Brdfils^ w'herc they
are y^ry ufeful in the great Hedts which are there :
Ahd Ifelt the Heats every jot as great here, anfl
ferdfair tod, "being nearer the Equinox \ befides, a*
I Wa& tibliged to be touch abroad, it i^as a ftioft
Ufeful ' thing to me, as well fdr the Rains as the
Heats. I took a world of Pains rit it, and was a
great while before I could make any thing likely to
hold j nay, after I thought I had hit the Way, I
fpoird i or 5 'b£fc(re I made oiie to -my ! Mind j 'bat

tt-laft I made one that anfwer'd indifferently well;
The main Difficulty I found was to make it to let
dqwn. I could make it to fpread, but if it did not
let dqwn top, and draw in, it was not portable for
me any Way bat juft over my Head, which would
not do. However, at laft, as I faid, I made one
to anfwer, and cover'd it with Skins, the Hair up-
wards^ fo that it call off the Rains like a Pent-
houfe, and kept off the Sun fo effeftually, that I
could walk out in the hotted of the Weather with
greater Advantage than I could before in the cool-
eft, and when I had no need of it, could clofeit and
carry it under my Arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my Mind be-
ing entirely compofed by refigning to the Will of
God, and throwing my felf wholly upon the DiP
pofal of his Providence. This made my Life bet-
ter than fociable; for when I began to regret the
want of Converfation, I would ask my felf whether
thus cpnverfing mutually with my own Thoughts,
and, as I hope I may fay, with cveti God himfelf
by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmoft
Enjoyment of human Society in the World ?

I cannot fay that after this, for five Years, any
extraordinary Thing happened to me, but I lived on
in the fame Gourfe, in the fame Pofture and Place,

{*uft as before; The chief Things I was employ'd in,
>efides my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and
Rice, and curing my Raifins, of both which I al-
ways kept up juft enough to have fufficient Stock
of one Year's Provifions beforehand 3 I fay, befides
this yearly Labour, and my daily Labour of going
out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a
Canoe , which at laft I finished : So that by digg-
ing a Canalto it.of fix Foot wide, and four Foot
deep, I brought it into the Creek, almoft half a
Mile, As for the firlt^wtich was fo vaftly big,

a$ I made it without confidering before-hind, a£ t
ought to do, how I fhould be able to launch itj fo
never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring
the Water to it, I was oblig'd to let it lie where it
was, as a Memorandum to teach me to be wifer
next Time : Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could
not get a Tree proper for it, and in a Place where
I could not get the Water to it, at any lefs Diftance
than as I have faid, near half a Mile j yet as I faw
it was prafticable at laft, I never gave it over $ and
though I was near two Years about it, yet I never
grudg'd my Labour, in Hopes of having a Boat
to go off to Sea at laft.

However, though my little Periagua was fi*
nifh'd, yet the Size of it was not at all anfwerable
to the Defign which I had in View, when I made
the firft > I mean, Of venturing over to the Terra
Firma^ where it was above forty Miles broad j ac-
cordinely* the Smallnefs of my Boat affifted to put
an End to that Defign, and now I thought no more
of it : But as I had a Boat, my next Defign was to
make a Tour round the Ifland 5 for as I had been
on the other Side, in one Place, eroding as I have
already defcrib'd it, over the Land % fo the Difco-
verietf I made in that little Journey, made me very
eager to fee other Parts of the Coaft 5 and now I
had a Boat, I thought of nothing but failing
round the Ifland.

For this Purpofe, that I might do every Thing
with Difcretioft and Confideration, I fitted up a lit*'
tie Maft to my Boat, and made a Sail to it* out of
feme of the Pieces of the .Ship's Sail, which lay in
itore j and of which I had a great Stock by me.

Having fitted my Maft and Sail, and try'd the
Boar, I found flie would fail very, well : Then I
made little Lockers, orBbxes* at either End of my
Boat) to put Provisions, Ncccffaries and Anmi&ni-

tion, 6fc . into, to be kept dry, either from Rain, or
the Spryc of the Sea* and a little long hollow
Place I cut in the Infide of the Boat, where I could
lay my Gun, making a Flap to hang down over
it to keep it dry,

I fix'd my Umbrella alfo in a Step at the Stern,
like a Maft, to ftand over my Head, and keep the
Heat of the Sun off of me like an Auning * and
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage
upop the Sea, but never went far out, nor far from,
the little Creek j but at laft being eager to view
the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I refolv'd
upon my Tour, and accordingly I vi&uali'd my Ship
for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of my Loaves
(Cakes I fhould rather call them) of Barley Bread,
an Earthen Pot full of parch 'd Rice, a Food I eat
a great deal of, a little Bottle of Rum, half a
Goaty and Powder and Shot for killing more* and
two large Watch-coats, of thofe which, as I men**
tion'd before, I had fav'd out of the Seamen's
Cheftsj thefe I took, one to lie upon, and the o-
ther to cover me in the Night.

It was the fixth of November r in the fixth Year
of my Reign, or my Captivity, which you pleafe,
That 1 fet out on this Voyage, and I found it much
longer than I expe&ed j for though the lfland itfelf
was not very large, yet when 1 came to the Eafi T
Side of it, I found a great Ledge of Rocks lie out
above two Leagues: into the Sea, fome above Wa-
ter,, fome under it 5 and beyond that, a Shoal of,
Sand, lying dry half a League more* fo that I wa$
oblig'd to go a great Way out tolSea to double the

again i fo I came to an Anchor -, for I tad made
me a kind of an Anchor j with a piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.

Having fecur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and
went on Shore, climbing up upon a Hill, which
feem'd to over-look that Point, where I few the
fott Extent of it, and refolv'd to venture.

In pAy viewing the'Sea from that Hill where I
ft66ti, 1 perceived a ftrong, and indeed, a moll fa-
firitfs Gittrent,' which run to the EaJ}, and even
came clofe to the Point 5 arid I took the more no-

with fuch Violence, that all I could do, could
not keep her fo much as on the Edge of it j but I
Found it hurry'd me farther and farther out from
the Eddy, which was on my Left Hand. There
was no Wind ftirring to help me, and all I could
do with my Paddlers fignify'd nothing 5 and now
1 began to give my felf over for loft ; for as the Cur-
rent was on both fides the Ifland, I knew in a few
Leagues Di fiance they mud joyn again, and then
I was irrecoverably gone * nor did 1 fee any Pofli-
bility of avoiding it $ fo that I had no Profpeft be-
fore me but of perifhing $ not by the Sea, for that
was calm enough, but of ftarving for Hunger. I
had indeed found a Tortoife on the Shore, as. big
almoft as I could lift, and had tofs'd it into the
Boat $ and I had a great Jar of frefh Water, that is
to fay, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all
this to being driven into the vaft Ocean, where to
be fure, there was no Shore, no main Land, or
Ifland, for a thoufand Leagues at lead.

And now I faw how eafy it was for the Provi-
dence of God to make the mpft miferable Condi-
tion Mankind could be in, worfe. Now I look'd
back upon my defolate folitary Ifland, as the moft
pleafant Place in the World, and all the Happinefs
my Heart could wifli for, was to be but there a-
ain. I ftrech'd out ipy Hands to it with eager
Vitiies. O happy Djefart, faid I, I fhall never fee
thee more ! O miferable treature, faid I, whi-
ther am I going ! Then I reproach 'd my felf with
my unthankful Temper, and how I had repin'd at
my folitary Condition j and now what would I give
to be on Shore there again? Thus we never fee
the true State of our Condition, till it is illultrated
to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the want of it. It is fcarce
poffible to imagine the Confternation 1 .was now in,

being driven from my beloved Ifland (for (b it ap-
peared to me now to be) into the wide Ocean, al-
moft two Leagues, and in the utmoft Defpair of
ever recovering it again. However, I work'd hard,
till indeed my Strength was almoft exhaufted, and
kept my Boat as much to the Northward^ that is,
towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy
lay on, as poffibly I could j when about Noon, as
the Sun pafs'd the Meridian, I thought I felt a lit-
tle Breeze of Wind in my Face, fpringingupfrom
the S. S. E. This chear'd my Heart a little, and
efpecially when in about half an Hour more, it
blew a pretty fmall gentle Gale. By this Time L
was gotten at a frightful Diftance from the Ifland,
tod had the leaft Cloud or hazy Weather intervened,
I had begii undone another Way too -, for I had no
Compafs on Board, and fhould never have known
how to have fteer'd towards the Ifland, if I had
but once loft Sight of it* but the Weather conti-
nuing clear, I apply'd my felf to get up my Maft
again, fpread my Sail, Handing away to the * North
as much as poflible, to get out of jhe Current.

Juft as I hadfet my Maft and Sail, and the Boat
began to ftretch away, I faw even by the Clearnefs
of the Water, fome Alteration of the Current was
near •, for where the Current was fo ftrong, the
Water was foul * but perceiving the Water clear,
I found the Current abate, and prefently I found
to the Eaft, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the
Sea upon fome Rocks * thefe Rocks I found caus'd
the Current to part again, and as the main Strefs of
it ran away more Southerly^ leaving the Rocks to
the North-Eaft j fo the other retui n'd by the Re-
pulfe of the Rocks, and made a ftrong Eddy,

jphat my prefpht Surprize of Joy was, and how glad*-
ly I put my Boar into the Stream of this Eddy, find
the Wind alfo frefhning, how gladly I fpread my
Sail to it, running ' chearfully before the Wind,
and with a ftrong >ide or Eddy under Foot.

This Eddy carry'd me about a League in my
^Vay back again dire&ly towards the Ifland, buf
about two Leagues more to the Northward than
the Current which carried me away at fir ft; (bthat.
when I came near the Ifland, I found my (elf opcr*
to the Northern Shore of it, that is to fay, the o-
ther End of the Ifland oppofite to that which I
went out from. J

When I had made fomething more than ? League
ibf ^ay by the Help of this Current or Eddy J founcj
it was (pent and ferv'd me no farther. However, I
found that being between the two great Currents.
(viz.) that on the South Side, which had hurried
me away, and that on the North, which layabout
a League on the other Side : I fay, bfpween thefc
two, in the Wake of the Ifland, I found the W^-
ter at lead ftill and running no Way > and having
yet a Breeze of Wind fair' for me, I kept on fteerr
ing dire&ly for the Ifland, thp 9 not making fuch
frcm Way as I did before.

About four a Clock in (he Evening, being then
within about a League of the Ifland, I found the

I ftretch'd a-crofs this Eddy flanting North-wefli
and in about an Hour came within about a Mile of
the Shore, where it being fmooth Water, I foot*
got to Land.

When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave
God Thanks for my Deliverance, refolving to lay
afide all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my Boat ;
and refrefhing my fclf with fiich Things as I had, I
brought my Boat clofe to the Shore in a little Cove
that I had fpy'd under fome Trees, and laid mc
down to fleep, being quite fpent with the Labour
and Fatigue of the Voyage.

I was now at a great Lois which way to gee
Home with my Boat : I had run fo much Hazard,
and knew too much the Cafe to think of attempt-
ing it by the Way I went out i and what might be
at the other Side (I mean the Weft Side) 1 knew
not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures $
fo I only refolved in the Morning to make my Way
Weftward along the Shore, and to fee if there was
no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safe-
ty, fo as to have her again if I wanted her. In about
three Mile, or thereabout, coafting the Shore,. J
came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile ovei^
which narrowed till it came to a very little jlivulet
or Brook, where I found a very convenient Harbour
for my Boat, and where 0ie lay as if fhe had beep
in a little Dock made on purpofe for hen Here I
put in, and having ftow'd my Boat very fafe, I went
on Shore to look about me, and fee where |;wft$

been upon, and I reach'd my old Bower in the
Evening, where I found every thing (landing as I
left it } for I always kept it in good Order, being,
as I faid before, my Country-Hoafe.

I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the
Shade to reft my Limbs, for I was very weary, and
fellafleep: But judge you, if you can, that read my
Story, what a Surprize I muft be in, when I was
wak'd out of my Sleep by a Voice calling me by
my Name fevcral tidies, Robin, Robin, Robin Crufoe,
Poor Robin Crufoe ! where are you Robin Crufoe ?
Where are you? W here have you been ?

I was fo dead afleep at firft, being fatigu'd with
Rowing, or Paddling, as it is caird, the firft
Part of the Day, and with Walking the latter Part,
that I did not wake thoroughly $ but dozing be-
tween fleeping and waking, thought I dream'd
that fome body fpoke to me : But as the Voice
continu'd to repeat, Robin Crufoe, Robin Crufoe, at
laft I began to wake more perfeftly, and was at
firft dreadfully frighted, and ftarted up in the ut-
moft Confternation : But no fooner were my Eyes
open, than Ifaw my Poll fitting on the top of the
Hedge, and immediately knew that it was he that
fpoke to me * for juft in fuch bemoaning Language
I had ufed to talk to him, and teach him $ and he
had learn'd it fo perfe&ly, that he would fit upon
my Finger, and lay his Bill clofe to my Face, and
cry, Poor Robin Crufoe, Where are you ? Where
-have you been? How come you here? and fuch things
as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the Parrot,
aikl that indeed it could be no body elfe, it was
a good while before I could compofe my felf :
Firft, I was amazed how the Creature got thither,
add then how he fhould juft keep about the Place,
and no where tlfe : Bqt as I was well fatisfied it

could

could be no body but honeft Polly I got it 6vcr$
and holding out my Hand, and calling him by bis *
Name Poll, the fociable Creature came to me, andN^
fat upon my Thumb, as he ufed to do, and conti- v ,
nued talking to me, Poor Robin Crufoe, and bow
did I come here ? and where bad I been ? juft as if he
had been overjoy 'd to fee me again j and fo I car-
ry*d him Home along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for
fome time, and had enough to dp for many Days
to fit {till, and refled upon the Danger I had been
in. I would have been very glad to have had
my Boat again on my fide of the Ifland; but I
knew not how it was pra&icable to get it about.
As to the Eaft fide of the Ifland, which I had
gone round, I knew well enough there was no ven-
turing that Way 3 my very Heart would fhrink, and
my very Blood run chill to think of it : And as
to the other fide of the Ifland, I did not know
how it might be there $ but fuppofing the Current
ran with the fame Force againft the Shore at the
Eaft, as it pafs'd by it on the other, ' I might mil
the fame Risk of being driven down the Stream,
and carry'd by the Ifland, as I had been before,
of being carry'd away from itj fo with thefe
Thoughts I contented my felf to be without any
Boat, though it had been the Produ& of fo many
Months Labour to make it, and of fo many more
to get it unto the Sea.

In this Government of my Temper I remained
near a Year, liv'd a very fedate retired Life, as
you may well fuppofej and my Thoughts being
very much compofed as to my Condition, and
fully comforted in refigning my felf to the Dif-

{>ofitions of Providence, I thought' I "liv'd real*
y very happily in all things, except, that of So-
ciety: '.■■*■



r 170 3



I improv'd my (elf in this time in all the mecha-
nick Exercifcs which my Neceffities put me upon
applying my felf to, and I believe I could, upon
Occafion, made a very good Carpenter^ efpecially
confidering how few Tools I had.

Befidcs this, I arrived at an unexpe&ed Perfecti-
on in my Earthen Ware, and contrived well enough
to make them with a Wheel, which I found infi-
nitely eafier and better \ becaufe I made Things
round and fliapable, which before were filthy
Things indeed to look on. But I think I was ne-
ver more vain of my own Performance, or more
joyful for any think I found out, than for my being
able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was
a very ugly clumfy thing, when it was done, and
only burnt red like other earthen Ware, yet as it
was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I
was exceedingly comforted with it ; for I had been
always ufed to fmoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, but I forgot them at firft, not knowing that
there was Tobacco in the Ifland j and afterwards,
when I fearch'd the Ship again, I could not come
at any Pipes at all.

In my Wicker Ware alfo I improved much, and
made abundance of neceflary Baskets, as well as
my Invention {hew'd me, though not very hand-
fome, yet they were fuch as were very handy and
Convenient for my laying Things tip in, or fetching
Things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat
abroad, I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and
drefs-it, and cut it in Pieces, and bring it home in
a Basket j and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it
tip, take out the Eggs, and a piece or two of the
Flefli, which was enough for me, and bring them
home in a Basket, and leave the reft behind
me. Alfo large deep Baskets were my Recei-
vers of my Corn, which I always rubb'd out as

foon



I *.7I 3



foon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great
Baskets.

I began now to perceive my Powder abated cons-
iderably, and this was a Want which it was im-
poffible for me to fupply, and I began fcrioufly to
cpnfider what I rauft do when I mould have no
more Powder ; that is to fay, how I ihoiild do to
kill any Goat. I had , as I obferv'd in the third
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred
her up tame, and I was in hope of getting a He-
Goat, but I could not by any means bring it to
pafs, till my Kid grew an old Coat > and 7 coujd
qever find in my Heart to kill her, till (he dy'd at
h& of mere Age.

But being now in the eleventh Year of my Refi-
dence, s*nd, as I have faid, my Ammunition grow-
ing low, I fet my felf to ftudy fome Art to trap and
fnare the Goats, to fee whether I could not catch
(pme of them alive, and particularly I wanted a She*
Goat great with Young.

To this purpofe I made Snares to hamper them,

and I do believe they were more than once taken

in them, but my Tackle was not good, for I had

. no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my

Bait devoured.

At length I refolvcd to try a Pit-fall, fo I dug
feveral large Pjts in the Earl* , in Places where I
had pbferved the Goats ufed tQ feed, and over thefe
Pits I placed Hurdles of my own making too*
with a great Weight upon them > and fevcraltime*
t put Ears of Barley and dry Rice, without fet*
ting the Trap, and I could eafily perceive that tho
Goats had gone in and eaten up the Corn 3 for I
could fee tjie Mark of their Feet* At length I fet
three Traps in one Ni(jht , and going the ne*5
Keening I fduftd them all ttanding, and yet tfac
W^^'^S^' Th«w^veiydifcourag^>

However, I alter'd ray Trap, and, not to trouble
you with Particulars, going one Morning to fee my
Trap, I found in ope of them a large old He-Goat,
and in one of the other three Kids, a Male, and
two Females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with
him, he was fo fierce I durft not go into the Pit to
him j that is to fay, to go about to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted. I could have
kilPd him, but that was not my Bufinefs, nor would
it anfwer my End. So I e'en let him out, and he
ran away as if he had been frighted out of
his Wits: But I had forgot then what I recollefted
afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I
had let him ftay there three or four Days without
Food, and then had carry'd him fome Water to
drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been
as tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty
fagacious tradable Creatures where they are well
ufed.

However, for the prefent I let him go, knowing
no better at that time - 9 then I went to the three
Kids, and taking them one by one, I tycd them
with Strings together, and with feme Difficulty
brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed, but
throwing them fome fweet Corn, it tempted them,
and they began to be tame : and now I found that
if I expe&cd to fupply my felf with Goat-Flefh
when I had no Powder or Shot left, breeding fome
up tame was my only Way, when perhaps I
might have them about my Houfe like a Flock of
Sheep.

But then it prefently occur'd to me, that I muft
keep the Tame from the Wild, or elfe they would
always run wild when they grew Up 5 and the only
Way for this was to have fomfc cnclofed Piece of
•••■ - • Ground



X i n ]



Ground, well fenc'd cither with Hedge or Pale, to
keep them info effe&ually, that thofe within might
not break out, or thofe without break in.

This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of
Hands, yet as I faw there was an abfolute Necef-
fity of doing it, my firft Piece of Work was to
find out a proper Piece of Ground, viz. where there
was likely to be Herbage for them to eat, Water
for them to drink, and cover to keep them from
the Sun.

Thofe who underftand fuch Enclofures will think
I had very little Contrivance, when I pitch'd upon
a Place very proper for all thefe, being a plain o-

?en piece of Meadow-Land or Savanna^ (as our
cople call it in the Weftern Colonies,) which had
two or three little Drills of frefh W ater in it, and
at one end was very woody : I fay they will fmile
at my Forccaft, when I {hall tell them I began my
enclofing of this Piece of Ground in fuch a man-
ner, that my Hedge or Pale muft have been at leaft
two Mile about. Nor was the Madnefs of it fo
great as to the Compafs, for if it was ten Mile a-
about I was like to have time enough to do it in.
But I did not confider that my Goats would be
as wild in fo much Compafs, as if they had had the
whole Ifland, and I fhould have fo much Room
to chace them in, that I ihould never catch
them.

My Hedge* was begun and carry'd on, I believe,
about fifty Yards , when this Thought occurr'd
to me j fo I prefently ftopt fhort, and for the firft
beginning I refolv'd to enclofe a Piece of about ifo
Yards in length, and ioo Yards in breadth, which
as it would maintain as many as I fhould
have in any reafonable time, fo as my Flock en-
creafed, \ could add more Ground to my En-
clofure.

This w*a$ a&ing with fome Prudence, and I went'
to work with Courage. I was about three Months
hedging m the firft Peice, and till I had done it t
tether'd tjie three Kids in the beft part of it, and
us'd them to feed as near me as poffible to malcc
them familiar ; arid very often I would go and car-
ry them fome Ears of Barley, or a handrul of Rice,
and feed them out of my Hand; fo that after my
Enclofure was finifhed, and 1 let them loofe, they
would follow me up and do^n, bleating after mef
for a handftil of Corn.

Tfiis anfwcr'd my End, atid f in' about a Year and
half I had a Flock of about twelve Goats, Klidsf
and all > and in two Years more I had three and
Forty, befides feveral that I took and kilPd for my
Food. And after that I enclofed five feveral Pie-
ces of Ground to feed them in* with little Peris' ttf
drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and
Gates out of one Piece of Ground into ano-
ther.

But this was not all, for now I not only had
Goats-Flefh to feed on when I pleas'd, but Milk
too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not fo much as think of, and which, when it came
into my Thoughts, was really an agreeable Sur-
prize. For now I fet up my Dairy, and had fome
times a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. Arid as
Nature, who gives Supplies of Food to every
Creature, di&ates even naturally how tb make ufe
of it y fo I that never milk'd a Cow, mtfch left
a Goat, or had feen Butter ot Cheefe made, very
readily and handily, tho' aftefr A great many Eflays
and Mifcarriages, made me both Butter and Cheefe
at laft, and never wanted it afterwards.

in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Ifland,
where, as I have faid, in my laft Ramble, I went up
the Hill to fee how the Shore lay, and how the
Current fet, that I might fee what I had to do : This
Inclination increased upon me every Day, and at

I had a great high fhapelefs Cap, made of a

well to keep the Sun from me, as to fhoot the Rain
off from running into my Neck ; nothing being fo
hurtful in thefe Climates, as the Rain upon the

fulof it, and living within nine or ten Degrees of the
Equine*. My Beard I had once faifcr'd to grow till
it was about' a quarter of a Yard long * but as I had

my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks j
and ^avmg<no Boat now to take care of, I went o-
ver the Land a dearer Way, to the fame Height that
X was upon before* when looking forward to the*
Point of the Rocks which lay out, and which I was
oblig'd* to daubed with my Boat, as is faid above,
J .was furpriz'd to. fee the Sea all fmooth and quiet,,
no Ripling, no Mttfion, no Current, any more there
than in other Places. .1.

-I was at a ftrange Lofs to undcrftand this, and
refolv'd to fpend fbme.Time in. the obferving it, to
fee if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had occa-.
fion'd it 5 but I wa8,prefently convinced how it was,
viz* That the-Tide.of Ebb fetting from the JVeft 9
and joining with the Current of Waters from fome
great River on the, Shore, muft be the occafion of
this Current j. and that according as the Wind blew
more forcibly, from the JVefi^ or from the Norths
this Current., came near r or went farther from
Shore v for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went
up to.the. Rock again, and then, the Tide of Ebb.
being made, I plainly faw the Querent again as be-
fore, only, that it run farther off, being near half a
League from the Shore 5 whereas in my Cafe, it
fet clofe upon the Shore, and.hurricd me and my
Canoe Along with it, which at another time it
would not have-done.

. This Obfervation convine'd me, That I had no-
thing, to do but to obferve the Ebbing and the
Flowing of t hi Tide, and I might very eafily bring
my Boat about the Ifland again: But when I be*

5ap to think of putting it irt.pra&ice, I had fuch a
"error upon, my Spirits' at the Remembrance of
the Danger I. had been in, .that I could not think

though more laborious > and this was, that I would
build, or rather make me another Pariagua or Ca-
noe j and fo have one for one Side of the Ifland, and
one for the other.

You are to underftand, that now I had, as I
may call it, two Plantations in the Ifland * on£ my
little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me,
which by this time I had enlarged into feveral
Apartments, or Caves, one within another. One
of thefe, which was the dryeft, and largeft, and
had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification %
chat is to fay, beyond where my Wall join'd to
the Rock, was all fill'd up with the large Earthen
Pots, of wliich I have given an Account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold
five or fix Bufhels each, where I laid up my Stores
of Provifion, efpeciaUy my Corn, fome ia the Ear
cut off fhort from the Straw, and the other rubb'd
out with my Hand.

As for my Wall made, as before, with long Stakes
or Piles, thofe Piles grew all like Trees, and were
by this Time grown fo big, and fpread fo very
much , that there was not the lead Appearance to
any one's View of any Habitation behind them.

Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther
within the Land, and upon lower Ground, lay my
two Pieces of Corn- Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and fow'd , and which duly yielded me
their Harveft in its Seafon $ and whenever I had
occafion for more Corn , I had more Land adjoin-
ing, as fit as that.

Be fides this. I had my Country Seat, and I had
now .a tolerable Plantation there alfo > forfirft, I
had my little Bower, as I calPd it, which I kept
in Repair j that is to Jay , I kept the Hedge which
circled it in, constantly fitted up to its ufual Height,

the ladder (landing always in the Infide* I kept
the Trees which at firft were no more than my
Stakes, but were now grown very firm and tall 5 I
kept thenft always fo cut, that they might fpread and
;row thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
rhadc, which they did effe&ually to my Mind. Id
the Middle of this I had my Tent always (landing,
being a Piece of a Sail fpread over Poles fet up for
that Purpofcj and which never wanted any Repair
.for RciVewing -, and under this I had made me a Squab
pr Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures I had
icjlPd , aM with other foft Things , and a Blan-
ket laid on them* fuch as belonged to our Sea-Bed-
ding, which I had faved, and a great Watch-Coat
to cover met and here, whenever 1 had Occafion
to be abfent from my chief Seat, I took up my
Couutry Habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my £nclofures for ray Cat-
tle, that is to fay, my Goats : And as I had taken
an inconceivable deal pf Pains to fence and enclofe
this Ground, (b I was fo uneafy to fee it kept entire,
left the Goats fhould break thro*, that I never left
off till with infinite Labour I had ftuck the Outfidc
of the Hedge fo full of fmall Stakes, and fo fiear to
one another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge,
and there was fcarce Room to put a Hand thro*
between then?, which afterwards when thofe Stakes
grew* as they all did in the next rainy Seafon, made
the Enctofure ftrong like a Wall , indeed flronge*
than any Will

This will teftify for me that I was not idle,
fend that I (pared 110 Pains to bring to pafs what-
ever appcar'd fleceflary for my comfortable Sup-
port 5 for 1 con&kr'd the keeping up a Breed of

forty Years, and that keeping them in my Reach,
/depended entirety upon my pcrfe&ing my Encfo'
fures to ftjch a Degree, that I might be lure of
keeping them together * which by this Method in~
deed I To effe&ually fecund, that when thefe lit-
tle Stakes began to grow, I had planted them fo
very thick, 1 was forced to pnU fome of them up
again.

In this Place alfo I had my Grape* growing,
which I principally depended on for my Winter
Store of Raifinsj and which I never faij'd to prc-
ferve very carefully, as the beft and rooft agreeable
painty of my whole Diet j and indeed shey were
not agreeable only, but phyfical, wholefcme, noy*
rifhing, and rcfreihing, to the laft Degree.

As this was alfo about half the Way between my
other Habitation and the Place were I had laid up
npy Boat, I generally ftay'd, and lay here in my
Way thither •, for I ufed frequently to vifit my
poat, and I kept all Things about or belonging to
her in very good Order j fometimes I went out
in her to (Avert my felf, but no more hazardous
Voyages wopld I go, nor fcarce ever' above a
Stone's C^ft or two from the Shore, I was fo ap-
prchenfive of being hijrried out of my Knowledge
again by the Current^ or Wi**^ or any other AgV
cident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life.

It happen'd one Day about Noon going towards
my Boat, I was exceedingly ft^rpri^d with the Print
or a Man's naked Foot or the Shore, which was
very plain to be feen in % he Sand ; I ftood likc:one
Thunder-ffrucjc, or as if I fcacl feen an Apparition ;
Iliiten'd, Ilook'd round ipe, I coiild bear nothing ,
nor fep $ny thing $ I went up to a rifing CJround to
look farther 5 I went up the Shore and down the
Shore, bu^ if was all one, I could fee no other

N \ |mjnrcffk>n

ImprefEon but that one, I went to it again toTee
if there were any more, and to obferve if it might
not be my Fancy $ but there was no Room for
that, for there wasexa£kly the very Print of a Foot,
Toes, Heel, and every Part of a Foot , how it
came thither, I knew not, nor could in the leaft
imagine. But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts,
like a Man perfe£Hy confus'd and out of my felf, I
came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we
fay, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to thelaft
Degree, looking behind me at every two or three
Steps, miftaking every Bufh and Tree, and fancy-
ing every Stump at a Diftance to be a Man $ nor is
it poffible to defcribe how many various Shapes af-
frighted Imagination reprefented Things to me in j
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment
in my Fancy, and what ftrange unaccountable
Whimfies cameintp my Thoughts by the Way.

When I came to my Caftle, for fo 1 think I call'd
it ever, after this, I fled into it like one purfued *
whether I went over by the Ladder as nrft con-
trtv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which
I call'd a Door, I cannot remember; no, nor could
1 remember the next Morning $ for never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more
Terror 6f ■ Mind than I to this Retreat.

I flept none that Night i the farther I was from
the Occafion pf my Fright, the greater my Ap-
prehenfions were j which is fomething contrary to
the Nature of fuch Things, and efpecially to the u-
fual Pra&ice of all Creatures in Fear : But I was
fo embarrafs'd with m^ own frightful Ideas of the
Thing, that I form'd nothing bqt difmal Imagina-
tions to my felf, even tho* I was now *a great way
ofFit. Sometimes I fancy'd it muft be the De-
vil y and Reafon joyn'4 in with ipc upon this Sup-
pofition ; For how fhpuld any other Thing ih hu-

man Shape come into the Place ?- T Where w*s-thc^
Vcflel that brought them ? Whati Marks was there «■
of any other Footfteps? And how was itpoffibler
a 1 Man fliould coftie there? But then to think that-
Satan fhould take human Shape upon him in fuch a
Place where there could be no manner of Occafion
for it, but to leave the Print of hi&JFoot; behind
him, and that even for no Purpofe too, for Jie could.
not be fure I fhould fee it ; this was an Arawfement
the other Way : I confidered that the Devil might
have found out abundance of other Ways to have
terrify'd me than this of the fingle. Print of a Foot.
That as I liv'd quite on theother Side of the Ifland,
fie would never have been fo fimple to leave a Mark
in a Place where it was Ten Thoufand to one whe-
ther I fhould ever fee it or not, and in the Sand
too, which the firft Surge of the Sea upon a high
Wind would have defoe'd entirely : All this feem'd
inconfiftent with the Thing it felf, and with all the
Notions we ufually entertain of the Subtilty of the
Devil.

Abundance of fiich Things as thefe affifted to ar-
gue me out of all ApprehcnGons of its being the
Devil : And I prefently concluded* then, tbatitmuft
be fome more dangerous Creature, (viz.) That it
mud be fome of the Savages of. the main Land
over-againft me, who had wandered out to Sea in
their Canoes, and either driven by the'Currents, or
by contrary Winds, had made the Iflandj and had
been on Shore, but were gone away again to Sea*
being as loth, perhaps, to havedtay'd in thtsdefo-
late Ifland, as I would have been to have had them.

While thefe Refle&ions were row ling upon my
Mind, I was very thankfui.in my Thoughts, that
I was fo happy .as not to be thereabouts at that
Time, or that they did not fee my Boat, by which
they would have concluded that fome Inhabitant;

N4 had

farther forma : Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my
Imagidgti^n about their having foqnd my Boat,
and that there wef e People here $ and that if fo, j
fhftuki certainly have them come again in greater
Numbers and devour me > that if it {hoy Id happen
fo that they ihould not find me, yet they wou!4
find my Enclofure, deftroy all my Corn, carry *-
way all my Flock of tame Goats, and I mould pe?
ji(h at laft for mere Want.

Thus my Fear banifh'd all my Religions Hope j
all that former Confidence in God, which was
founded upon fiich wonderful Experience as I bad
had of his Goodnefs, now yanifh'd, as if he that
had fed me by Miracle hitherto, could not prefervq
by his Power the Provifion which he had made for
met by his Goodnefs : I reproach'd my fe]f with my
Eaflnefs, that would not fo w any more Corn on?
Year than would juft ferve me till the next Seafon,
as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my
enjoying the Crop that was upon the Ground 5
and this I thought fo juft a Reproof, that I refolv'd
for the future to have two or three Years Corn be*
fore hand, fo that whatever might Come, 1 might

This was exemplified in me at this time in the molt
lively Manner imaginable : for I whofe only Af-

jdemn'd to what I call'd filent kife; that I wa* as
one whom Heaven thought not jvorthy to be nuia« .
ber'd amopg the giving, or to appear among the
reft of his Creatures j that to have feenone of my
own Species would have feem'd to me a Raifing
me from Death to Life, and the greateft Bleffing
that Heaveq itfelf, next to the ftjprpme Bleffing of
Salvation, could beftow - 9 ] fry, that I fliould now
tremble at the very Apprehenfions of feeing a Man,
and was ready to (ink into the Ground at but the
Shadow, or filent Appearance pf a Man's having
fet his Foot in the 111 and.

Such is the uneven State of human Life : And it
afforded me a great many curious Speculations af-
terwards. When I had a little recovered my firft
Surprize^ I confider'd that this was the Station of
Life the infinitely wife and good Providence of
pod had determin'd for me ; that as I could not
forefee what the Ends of Divine Wifdpm might be
in all this, fo I was not to difpute his Sovereignty,
who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and difpofe of me 3b-
folutely as he thought fit > and who, as I wa$ %
Creature who had offended him, had likewife a ju-
dicial Right to condemn me to what Punifhmcat
he thought fit * and that it w^s my part to fubmit
to bear his Indignation, beewfe J had finn'd againity
him.

I then refie&ed that God, who was not only
Righteous t>itf Omnipotent, as \ic had thought
£t thus to pypifh and afflid me, fo be was able

[ 1 85 ]



Thefc Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days,
nay, I may fay, Weeks and Months 5 and one par-
ticular Effeft of my Cogitations on this Occafion,
I cannot omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in
my Bed, and fill'd with Thought about my Danger
from the Appearance of Savages, I found it dif-
compos'd me very much 5 upon which thofe Words
of the Scripture came into my Thoughts, Call upon
me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver , and thou
Jhalt glorify me.
. Upon this, rifing chearfully out of my Bed, my
Heart was not only comforted, but I was guided
and encouraged to pray earneftly to God for Deli-
verance: When Ihad done praying, I took up my
Bible, and opening it to read, the fit it Words that
prefcnted to. me, were, Wait on the Lord, and be of
good Cheer, and he Jhall ftrengthen thy Heart 5 wait,
I fay, on the Lord. It is impoffible to exprefs the
Comfort this gave me. In Anfwer, I thankfully
laid down the Book, and was no more fad, at leafl
not on that Occafion.

In the middle of thefe Cogitations, Apprehenfi-
ons and Refleftions, it came into my Thought one
Day, that all this might be a mere Chimera of my
own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my
own Foot, when I came on Shore from my Boat :
Thischear'd me up a little too, and I began to per-
fuade my felf it was all aDelufion > that it was no-
thing elfe but my own Foot •, and why might not I
come that way from the Boat, as well as 1 was go-
ing that way to the Boat : Again, Iconfider'd alfo
that I could by no means tell for certain where I
had trod, and where I had not * and that if at lift
this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had
play'd the part of thofe Fools, who ft rive to make
Stories of Spedfcres and Apparitions, and then are

frighted at them more than any body.

■ n . , Now

No\V I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad
again - y for I had not ttirr'd out of my Caftle tor three
Days and Nights •, fo that I began to ftarve for
Provifion > for I had little or nothing within Doors
bdt fome Barley Cakes and Water. Then I knew
that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too, which
ufually was my Evening Diverfion % arid the poor
Creatures were in great Pain and Inconvenience for
Xvant of it j and indeed, it alrnoft fpoil'd fome of
them, and almoft dry'd up cheir Milk.

Heartning my felf therefore with the Belief that
this was nothing but the Print of one of my own
Feet, and fo I might be truly faid to ftart at my
own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and
went to my Country Houfe to milk my Flock j but
to fee with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and
then to lay down my Basket, and run for my Life, it
would have made any one have thought I was haunt-
ed with an evil Conscience, or that I had been late-
ly moft terribly frighted, and fo indeed I had.

However, as 1 went down thus two or three
Days, and having feen nothing, I began to be a lit*
tie bolder ; and to think there was really nothing in
ft, but my own Imagination : But I cou'd not per-
fuade my felf fully of this, till I fhould go down to
the Shore again, and fee this Print of a Foot, and
meafuTe it by my own, and fee if there was any Si-
militude or Fitnefs, that 1 might be aflur'd it was
my own Foot : But when I came to the Place,
F;>/?, it appeared evidently to mc^ that when I laid
up my Boat, I could not poffibly be on Shore any
where there about. Secondly , When 1 came to mea-
furethe Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot
not fo large by a great deal j.both thefe Things filFd
my Head with new Imaginations, and gave me the
Vapours again, to the higheft Degree r (o that I

(hook with cold, like one in an Ague : And I went
Home again, fill d with the Belief that fome Maq
or Men had been on the Shore j or in fhort, that the
Ifland was inhabited, and I might be furpriz'd be*
fore I was aware j and what courfe to take for my
Security I knew not.

O what ridiculous Refolutions Men take t when
poflefs'd with Fear ! It deprives them of the Ufe of
thofe Means which Reafon offers for their Relief?
The firft thing I proposed to my felf, was, to
throw down my Enclosures, and turn all my tame
Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might
not find them 5 and then frequent the Ifland in Profr
pefl: of the fame, or the like Booty : Then to the
iimple thing of digging jjp my two Corn Fields,
that they might not find Inch a Grain there, and
ftill be prompted to frequent the Ifland > then to de-
molish my Bower and Tent, that they might not
fee any Veftiges of Habitation, and be prompted
to look farther, in order to find out the Perfons
inhabiting.

Theft were the Subjeft of the firft Night's Co-
gitation, after I was come Home again, while th$
Apprchenfions which had fo over-run my Mind
were frefh upon me, and my Head was full of Va-
lours, as above. Thus Fear of danger is ten thou-
&nd Times more terrifying than Danger it felf, when
apparent to the Eyes j and we find the Burthen
pf Anxiety greater by much, than the Evil which
we are anxious about * and which was worfe thai\
9II this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble
from the Refignation I ufed to pra$ife, which I
hqp'd to have. I look'd, I thought, lite Sa*I> whot
£oxnplain'd not only that the Pbilijiines were upon
turn* but that God had forfaken him i for I did not
now take due Ways to compofe my Mind, by crying
to Qpd in npy Piftrpfc, and retting upon bis Provi-

dence^

tfetiCe, as I had done before, for my Defence and
Deliverance j which if I had done, I had, at leaft^
been more cheerfully fupported under this new Sur-

{>rife, and perhaps carry'd through it with more Res-
olution.

This confufion of my Thoughts kept me waking
all Night j but in the Morning I fell afleep, and
having by the Amufemdnt of my Mind, been, as it
W£re tired, and my Spirits exhaufted, I flept very
foundly* and wak'd much better compos'd than
I had ever been before : and now I began to think
fedatdys and upon the Utmoft Debate with my
fcHyl concluded, That this I (land, which was to
exceeding pleafant* fruitful, and no fart her from the
main Land than as I had feen, was not fo entirely a*
bandotfd as I might imagine : That altho' there
were no ftated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spots
yet that there might fometimes come Boats offfrora
the Shore, who either With Defign, or perhaps
ttevet but when they were driven by crofs Winds
might come to this Place.

That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had
not met tthh the leaft Shadow or Figure of any
People yet * and that if at any Time they fhouki be
driven here^ it was probable they went away again
as fcon as ever they could, feeing they had never
thought fit co fix there upon any Occafion, to this
Time.

That the faoft I cou'd fuggeft any Danger from,
was, from fttoy fuch cafnal accidental Landing of
ftttggttftg People from the Main, who, as it was
likely if they were driven hither, were here againft
their Wills * fo they made no ftay here, but went off
agaift with all poffible Speed, fddom flaying one
Night oil Shore, lead th*y fhould not have the
Help of the Tides, and Daylight back again j and
that thefriott I had nothing to do but co coofider



;[ ibo J



of fdmc faFc Retreat, in cafe I fhouid fee any Sava*
ges land upon the Spot.

Now I began forely to repent, that I had dug
my Cave fo large, at to bring a Door through a-
gain, which Door, as I faid,came out beyond where
my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock : upon mature-
ly confidering this therefore, I refolv'd to draw mc
a (econd Fortification, in the fame Maqner of a Se-
micircle, at a Diftance from my Wall, juft where I
had planted a double Row of Trees, about twelve
Years before, of wliich I made mention : Thefe
Trees having been planted fo thick before, they
wanted but a few Piles to be driven between them,
that they.ihould be thicker, and ftronger, and my
Wall would be foon finifli'd.

So that I had now a double Wall, and my outer
Wall was thickned with Pieces of Timber, old Ca-
bles, and every Thing I could think of to make it
fttong ; having in it feven little Holes , about as
big as I might put my Arm out at : In the Infide
of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten Foot
thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my
Cave, and laying it at the Foot of the Wall, and
walking upon it * and through the feven Holes, I
contriv'd to plant the Mufquets, of which I took
Notice, that I got feven on Shore out of the Ship 5
thefe, I fay, I planted as Cannpn, and fitted
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage,
that fo I could fire all the feven Guns in two Mi-
nutes time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finishing, and yet never thought myfelf fafe till it
was done.

When this was done, I (luck all the Ground
without my Wall, for a great way every way, as
full with Stakes or Sticks of the 0/*r-like Wood,
which I found fo apt to grow, as they could well
(land 5 infomuch, that I believe I might fee in near

twenty



I l 9* ]



twenty thoufand of them, leaving a pretty large >
Space between them and my Wall, that I might
have room to fee an Enemy, and they might have
no flielter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer Wallo ,

Thus in two Years time I had a thick Grove,
and in five or fix Years time I had a Wood before
my Dwelling , growing fo monftrous thick and
itrong, that it was indeed perfe&ly impaffrble;
and no Men of what kind foever, would ever una*-
gine that tfiere was any Thing beyond it, much lefe
a Habitation. As for the Way which I propofed to
myfelf to go in and out, for I left no Avenue, it
was by fetting two Ladders $ one to a Part; of the
Rock which was low, and then broke in, and left
room to place another Ladder upon that; fo when
the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living
could come down to me without mifchiefing him-
felf> and if they had come down, they were ftiU
on the Out-fide of my outer Wall.

Thus I took all the Meafures human Prudence
could fuggelt for my own Preservation j and it will
be feen at length, that they were not altogether
without juft Reafon > though I forefaw nothing at
that Time, more than my mere Fear fuggefted to
me.

While this was doing, I was not altogether care?
lefs of my other Affairs 5 for I had a great Concern
.upon me, for my little Herd of Goats > they were
not only a prcfent Supply to me upon every Occa-
iion, and began to be fufficient to me, without the
Expenceof Powder and Shot} but alfo without the
fatigue of Hunting after the wild Ones j and I was
loth to lofe the Advantage of them, and to have
them all to nurfe up over again.

To this Purpofe, after long Confideration, I
could think of but two Ways to preferve them : i



C *9* ]



Dtie was to find another convenient Place to dig k
Cave under Ground, attd to drive them into it every
Night ; and the other Was to enclofe two or three
little Bits of Land* remote from one another, and as
much conceal'd as I could, where I tbight keep a*
bout half a Dozen young Goats in each Place : So'
that if any Difafter happen'd to the Flock in gene*
ral, I might be able to raife them again with littlfe
Trouble and Time : And this, tho' it would re<-
<juire a great deal of Tifrte and Labour, t thought
Was the moil: rational Defign.

Accordingly I fpent fome Time to find out the
molt ritir'd Parts of the Ifland ; *ftd 1 pitchM up*
on one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wiih for j it was a little damp Piece of Ground
in the middle of the Hollow and thick Woods^
.where, as is obferv'd, I almoft loft ttiyfelf once be*
fb*e, endeavouring to come back that Way from
fchte Eaftern Part of the Ifland : Here I found a cleat
Piece of Land near three Acres, fo furrounded with
Woods, thatk was almoft an Enclosure by Nature*
tat lead it did not want near fo much Labour ttf
make it fo, as the other Pieces of Ground I had
Wofk'd fo hard at.

I immediately Went to work with this Piece rf
Ground, and in lefs than a Month's Time, I had
ib fenced it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
Which you pkafe, who were not fo wild now as at
firft tfeey fright be fuppofed to be, were well e*
aough fecur'd ill it. So without any farther De*-
lay, I removed ten young She- Goats and two He*
Goats to this Piece $ and when they were there, I
continued to perfeft the Fence tiH I had made if.
*s fectore as the other, which, however, I did at
more Leifure, and it took me up more Tittc by k
great deal.



Ew?3

All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely
from my Apprehenfions on the Account of die Prim
t>f a Man's Fqot whifch I had feen ; for as yet I
never faw any humane Creatufe come near the
Ifland, and 1 had now liv*d two Tears under theft
Uneafineffes, which indeed made my Life much left
comfortable than it was before ; as may well bt
imaging by arty who know what it id to live in
the conftattt Snare of the Fear cf Man ; and this I
muft obfdrve with Grief too, that the Difcompo*
lure of toy Mind had too great Impreffions alio up**
on the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the Dread
and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages
and Canibals lay fo upon my Spirits, that I feldom
found my felf in a due Temper for Application to
my Maker, at leaft not with the fedate Calmneft
' and Refignation of Soul which I was wont to do ; 2
"rather prayM to God as under great Affli&ion and
Freffure ot/Mifld, furrouflded with Danger, and in
Expeftation every Night of being murder'd and de^
Vour'd before Morning ; and I muft teftify from my
" Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankfulnefs*
Love and Affe&ion, is much the more proper Frame
Jot Prayer than that of Terror and Difcompofureij
and that tinder the Dread of Mifchief impending,
a Man is no more fit for a comforting Performance
of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for Re*
pentance on a Sick-bed : For thefe Difcompofures
affed the Mind as the others do the Body ; and the
Difcompofure of the Mind muft necetfarily be as
great a Difability as that of the Body, and much
greater, praying to God being properly an A& of
the Mind, not of the Body.

But to go on ; After I had thus fecur'd 4tae Pait
of my little living Stock, I Went about the whole
Ifland, Searching for another private Place, to make

O fucft



(uch ano ber Depofit ; when wandring more to the
Weft Point of the Ifland than I had ever done yet,
and looking out to Sea, I thought I faw a Boat up-
on the Sea, at a great Diftance ; I had found a Pro-
ipe&ive-Glafs , or two, in one of the Seamen s
Chefts, which I fav'd put of our Ships ; but I had
it not about me, and this was fo remote, that I could
not tell what to make of it ; though I look'd at it
till my Eyes were not able to hold to look any
longer; whether it was a Boat, or hot, I do not
know ; but as I defcended from the Hill, I could
fee no more of it, fo I gave it over ; only I refolv'd
to go no more out without a Profpe&fve-Glafs in
my Pocket.

When I was come down the Hill, to the End of
the Ifland, where indeed I Jiad never been before,
I was presently convincM, that the feeing the Print
of a Man's Foot, was not fuch a {(range Thing in
the Ifland as I imagined ; and but that it was a fpe-
cial Providence that I was caft upon the Side of the
Ifland, where the Savages never came , I fhould ea-
fily have known, that nothing was more frequent
than for the Canoes from the Main, when they hap-
pened to be a little too far out at Sea, to (hoot over
to that Side of the Ifland for Harbour ; like wife as
they often met, and fought in their Canoes, the Vic-
tors having taken any Prifoners, would bringt hem
over to this Shore, where, according to their dread-
fid Cuftoms, being all Gmibals, thisy. would kill and
eat them ; of which hereafter.

When I was come down the Hill to the Short,
as I faid above , being the S. W. Point of the
Ifland, I was perfe&ly confounded and amaz'd ; nor
is it poflible tor me to exprefs the JJorror of my
Mind, at feeing the Shore fpread^with Skulls,
Hands, Feet, and other Bones of humane' Bodies ;
and particularly I obferv'd a Place where there had

been



C *95 1

been a Fire made, and a Circle dug ifi the Earttt,
like a Cockpit, where it is fuppofed the Savage
Wretches had fat down to theit inhumane Feaftings
tipon the Bodies of their Fellow-Creatures.

I was fo aftonilh'd with the Sight of thefe Things^
that I entertaih'd no Notions of any Danger to m$
fclf from it for a long while ; all my Apprehen-
fions were buried in the Thoughts of fuch a Pitch
of inhumane, hellifh Brutality, and the Horror of
the Degeneracy of humane Nature ; which tho' £
had heard of often, yet I never had fo near a View
bf before ; in &ort, I turned away my Face froni
the horrid Spectacle ; my Stomach grew fick> and
1 was juft at the Point of Fainting , vrhen Natur^
difcharg'd the Diforder from my Stomach ; and ha-
ving vomited with an uncommon Violence, I waif
fL little relieved ; but could not bear to fray in the?
Place a Moment ; fo I gat ine up the Hill again^
with all the. Speed I could, and walked on tbwardsf
my own Habitation;

When I came a little out 6£ that Part 6( the
Ifland, I flood frill a, while as amafc'd ,' and then re-
covering my felf; 1 ldbk'd up with the utmoft Atkcr
tion of my Soul; and with a JFtood of Tears in my
Eyes, gave God Thanks that had caft my firfl Lot;
in a Part of the World, where I was diftingniih'a
from fuch dreadful Creatures as thefe ; and thit
tho' I had cfteem'd my prefent Condition very mi-
ferable, had yet given the fo many Comforts in it,
that I had frill more to give Thanks for than tcr
fcomplain of ; and this above all, that I had even in
this miferable Condition been comforted with the
Knowledge of himfelf, and the Hope of his Ble'f-
fing, which was a Felicity more than fufficiently
equivalent to all the Mifcry which I had fuffer'd* tt
feould fuffer.



[I 9 «]

In this Frame of Thankfulnefs, I went Home to
my CafUe, and began to be much eafier now, as to
the Safety of my Circumftances, than ever I was
before; for I obferv'd that thefe Wretches never
came to this Ifland in fearch of what they could
get ; perhaps not feeking, not wanting, or not ex-
pediting any Thing here ; and having often, no
doubt, been up in the cover'd woody Part of it,
without finding any Thing to their Purpofe. I knew
I had been here now almoft eighteen Years, and ne-
ver faw the leaft Foot-fteps of humane Creature
there before ,• and I might be here eighteen more
as entirely conceal'd as I was now, if I did not dip
cover my felf to them, which I had no manner of
Occafion to do, it being my only Bufinefe to keep
my felf entirely concealed where I was, unlefe I
found a better fort of Creatures than Cantbals to
make my felf known to.

Yet I entertain'd fuch an Abhorrence of the Sa-
vage Wretches, that I have been fpeaking of, and
of the wretched inhuman^ Cuftom of their devour-
ing and eating one another up, that I continued pen-
live, and fad, and kept clofe within my own Circle
for almoft two Years after this : When I fay mf
ibwn Circle, I mean by it, my three. Plantations,
viz,, my Gaftle, my Country Seat, which I calTd
nty Bower, and my Enclofure in the Woods ; nor
did I took after this for any other Ufe than as an
Enclofure for 'my Goats ,• for the Averfion which
Nature gave me to thefe hellifh Wretches was
fuch, that I was fearful of feeing them, as of feeing
the Devil himfelf ; nor did I fo much as go to look
"after my Boat in all this time ; but began rather
to think of making me another ; for I could not
'think of ever making any moit^Attempts, to bring
the other Boat round the Ifland to me , left I
fiiould meet with fome of thefe Creatures at Sea,

^-i in

in which, if I had happened to have fallen into their
Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.

Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that
I was in no Danger of being difcovered by thefe
People, began to wear off my Uneafinefs about
them ; and I began to live juft in the fame composed
Manner as before ; only with this Difference, that
I ufed more Caution, and kept my Eyes more a-
. bout me than I did before, left I fhould happen to
be feen by any of them ; and particularly, I was
more cautious of firing my Gun, left any of them
being on the Ifland, fhould happen to hear of it;
and it was therefore a very good Providence to me,
that I had furniflTd my felf with a tame Breed of
.Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the
Woods, or fhoot at them ; and if I did catch any
x>f them after this, it was by Traps, and Snares,
. ^s I had done before ; (o that for two Years after
. this, I believe I never fir'd my Gun one e off, tho* I
never went out without it ; and which was more, as
I had fav'd three Piftols out of the Ship, I always
./carried them out with me, or at leaft two of them,
flicking them in my Goat-Skin Belt ; alfo I fiirbifh'd
up one of the great Cutlafhes, that I had out of the
Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on alfo ; fo that
I was now a moft formidable Fellow to look at,
when 1 went abroad, if you add to the former De-
scription of my felf, the Particular of two Piftols,
and a great broad Sword hanging at my Side in a
Belt, but without a Scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have faid, for fome
Time ; I feem'd, excepting thefe Cautions, to be
jreduc'd to my former calm fedate way of Living,
all thefe Things tended to (hewing me more and
more how far my Condition was from being mife-
rable, compared to fome others ; nay, to ihany o-
ther Particulars of Life, which it might have pl</a~

fed Gpd to have made my Lot. It put we upon
refle&ing, ho^ little repining there would be
amoiig Mankind, at any Conditipn of Life, if Peor
pie wpuld rather compare their Conditipn with
thofe that are wprfe, in order to be thankful, than
be always comparing them with thqfe which are
better, to £flift their Murmuring? and Complain-
mgs.

As in my prcfent Condition there were not really
many Things which I wanted ; fo indeed I thought
that the Frights t had been in about thefe favage
Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for my
pwh Prefervatipn, had taken off the Edge of my Inr
yentiop for my own Conveniences; and Ihad'drop'd
a good Lfefign, which I had once bent my Thoughts
^oo much upon ; and that was, to try if I could not
xnake fome of my Barley into Malt, and then try
to brew my (elf fome Beer : This was really a whh$-
fical Thought, and I reprov'd my fejf often for the
"^niplicity of it ,• for I prefently (aw there woulcl
>e the* Want of feveral Things necef&ry to the
faking ipiy Beer, that it would be* impoflible for
me to Tupply' : As Firft, Casks to £re(erve it in',
Which was a Thing, that as I have obferv^ alrea-
dy,! could never compafs; ho, tho'I fpent not
inany Days, but Weeks, nay Months in attempt-
ing it, but to no purpofe. In the next Place, I had
ho Hops to make it kedp, no Teaft to make it work,
ho Copper or Kettle to make it boil ; and yet* all
jhefe Things, notwithftanding, I verily ; believe; had
hot thefe Things intervened, I mean the Frights and
Terrors I was in about the Ravages, 1 had under-
taken it, and*" perhaps brought it to pafs too ; for 1
jfeldom £ave any Thing over without accompIiQiing
it, when 1 6nce had it in my Head enough to begin

But my Invention now run quite another Way j
for Night and Day I could think of nothing but
how I might deftroy fomeofthefeMonftersin their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and, if poffible, fave
the Vi&im they fhould bring hither to deftroy. It
would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be, to fet down all the Contri*
vances I hatched, or rather brooded upon in my
Thought, for the deftroying thefe Creatures, or at
leaft frighting them, fo as to prevent their coming
hither any more ; but all was abortive, nothing
could be poffible to take Effeft, unlefs I was to be
there to do it my felf ; and what could one Man
do among them, when perhaps there might' be
twenty or thirty of them together , with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which they
could fhoot as true to a Mark, as I could with my
Gun ?

Sometimes I contrived to dig a Hole under thj:
Place where they made their Fire, and put in five
or fix Pounds of Gun-powder, which when they
kindled their Fire, would confequently take Fire,
and blow up all that was near it ; but as in the firft
Place I fliould be very loth to waft fo much Powder
upon them, my Store being now within the Quan-
tity of one Barrel ,- fo neither could I be fure of its
going off, at any certain time, when it might fur-
prize them, and at beft, that it would do little more
than juft blow the Fire about their Ears and fright
them, but not fufficient to make them forfake the
Place ; fo I laid it afide, and then proposed, that
I would place my felf in Ambufh, in fome con-
venient Place, with my three Guns, all double
loaded ; and in the middle of their bloody Cere-
mony let fly at them , when I fhould be fure to kill
pr wound perhaps two or three at every fhoot ,• and
then falling in upon them .with my three Piftol&

And my Sword, I made no doubt but that if there
yras twenty I fhould kill them all. This Fancy
pl?as'd my Thoughts for fome Weeks, and I was
fo full of it, that' I often dream'd of it ,• and fome-
times ? that I was juft going to let fly at them in my
Sleep.

\ I went fo far with it in my Imagination, that I
cmploy'd.iny felf feveral Days to' find out proper
places tQ put my felf in Ambufcade, as I faid, to
^atch for thejn ; afid I went frequently to the Place
it fel£ yrhich was no\jrgrown more familiar to me ;
and efpecially while my Mind was thus fill'd with
Thoughts ot Revenge, and of a bloody putting
fwenty or thirty of them to the Sword, as I may
call it j the Horror I had at the Place, and at the
Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring one
another; abated my Malice.
" tyell, at length J found a Place in the Side of the
jHill, where I was fa'tisfy'd I might fecurely wait^
fill I faW any of their Boats coming, and might
then, even before they would be ready to come on
Shoite, convey my felf unfeen into Thickets of Trees,
In pfte of Which there was a Hollow larrc enough
to conceal me entirely ,• and where I ihight fit, and
pbferve all their bloodv Doings, and tike my full
aim at their Heads, when they were fo clofe toge-
ther/ as that ii: would be next to impoffible that I
Should mifs my Shoot, or that I could fail wound*
ing three' or fodr of them at the firft Shoot.
; In 'this Place then 'I fefolved to fix my Defign f
and accordingly I prepared two id iiskets and my
prdinairy Fo\tfling-pifete. "' 'The two Muskets I
tbaded with a Brace cif Slugs each, and four or five
linaller Bullets; abolit the Size of Piftol Bullets •
*hd the Fowling-piece I loaded with hear it' Hand-
^1 of S'\Va[n-ftof, p£ the largeft Size ; I alfo loaded

jny PJftoTifaith about four Bullets each, and in this

.ET, • .•»■■• • . .-.: .,.-»• pbftu^;



JPofture, well provided with Ammunition for a fe->
cond and third Charge, I prepaid my felf for my
Expedition.

After 1 had thus laid the Scheme of my Defign,'
and in my Imagination put it in Pra&ice, I conti-
nually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top of the Hill, which was from my Caftle, as I
calTd it, about three Miles, or more, to fee if I
could obfetve any Boats upon the Sea, coming near
the Ifland, or (landing over towards it j but I be-
gan to tire of this hard Duty, after I had for two
qr three Months conftantly kept my Watch ; but
came always back without any pifcovery, there
having not in all that Time been the leaft Appear-
ance, not only on, or near the Shore ; but not on
the whole Ocean, fo far as ray Eyes or GlaflTes could
reach every Way*

As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill
to look out, fo long alfo I kept up the Vigour of
my Defign, and my Spirits feem'd to be all the
while in a fuitable Form, for fo outragious an Exe-
cution as the killing twenty or thirty naked Savages,
for an Offence which I had not at all entred into z
Difcuffion of in my Thoughts, any further than my
Paffions were at firft fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd
at the unnatural Cuftom of that People of the Coun-
try, who it fcems had been fufter'd by Providence^
in his wife Difpofition of the World, to have no
other Guide than that of their own abominable and
vitiated Paffions ; and ctonfequefltfy were left, and
perhaps had been fo for fome Ages, to ad fuch
horrid Things , and receive fuch dreadful Of
ftom$, as nothing but Nature entirely abandoned
of Heaven, and afted by fome hellifli Degeneracy,
eould have run them into : But now when, as I
liave faid, I began to be weary of the fruitless Ex-
curfion which I had made fo long, and fo far, eve-



[ *>* ]

ry Morning in vain, fo my Opinion of the Adioa
itfelf began to alter, and I began with cooler and
calmer Thoughts to consider what it was I was go-
ing to engage in. What Authority or Call I had,
to pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon thefe
Men as Criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for fo many Ages to fuffer, unpunifh'd, to go on,
and to be, as it were, the Executioners pf hjs Judg-
ments one upon another. How far thefe People
were Offenders againft me, and what Right I had
to engage in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they
flied promifcuoufly one upon another. I debated
this very often with my felf thus; How do I know
what God himfelf judges in this particular Cafe ? it
is certain thefe People do not cpmmit this as a
Crime ; it i$ not againft their own Conferences re*>
proving, or their Light reproaching them. They
do not know it to be an Offence, and then commit
it in Defiance of divine Juftice, as we do in almoft
all the Sins we commit. They think it no more a
Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than we do
to kill an Ox ; nor to eat humane Flefli, than we do
to eat Mutton.

When I had confider'd this a little, it followed ne-
ceffarily, that I was certainly in the Wrong in it $
that thefe People were not Murderers in the Senfe
that I had before condemned them in my Thoughts j
*ny more than thofe Chriftians were Murderers, who
often* put to Death the Prifoners taken in Battle ;
or more frequently, upon many Occafions, put
whole Troops of Men to the Sword, without gi?
ving Quarter, tho' they threw down their Arms
jttd fubmitted.

In the next Place it occur'd me, that albeit the
Ufage they thus gave one another was thus brutifh
and inhumane ; yet it was really nothing to me :
fhefe People had done me no Injury. That if they

attempted

F*. v .



attempted me, or I faw it necefiary for my immei
/diate Prefervation to fall upon them, fomcthing
might be faid for it ; bat that as I was yet out of
their Power, and they had really no Knowledge of
me, and consequently no Defigaupon me ; and there*
lore it could not be juft for me to fall upon them*
That this would juftify the Condu$ of the Spahutrdt
in all their Barbarities pradis'd in America, where
they deftroy'd Millions of thefe People, who, how-
ever they were Idolaters and £arbarians> and had fe*
veral bloody and barbarous Rites in their Cuitoms*
fuch as facrificing humane Bodies to their Idols,
were yet, as tp the Spaniards, very innocent People *
and that the rooting them out of the Country, it
•fpoken of with the utmoft Abhorrence and Detefta*
tion, by even the Spaniards themielves, at this Time£
and by all other Chriftian Nations of Europe, as a
mere Butchery, a bloody and unnatural Piece of
Cruelty, unjuftifiable either to God or Man ; and
fuch, as for winch the very Name of a Spaniard i$
reckoned to be frightful and terrible to all People of
Humanity, or of Chriftian Companion : As if th*
Kingdom of Spain were particularly Eminent fofc
the Produft of a Race of Men, who were without
Principles of Tendernefs, or the common Bowels of
Pity to the Miferable, which is reckoned to be &
Mark of generous Temper in the Mind.

Thefe Considerations really put me to a Paufe
and to a kind of a full Stop ; and I began by little
and little to be off of my Defign, and to conclude, I
had taken wrong Meafures in my Refolutions to at^
tack the Savages ; that it was not my Bufinefs to
meddle with them, unlefs they firft attacked me, anil
his it was my Bufinefs if poifible to prevent ; but
at if I were difcover'd, and attack*!, then I kne^r

On the other hand, I argu'd with my felf, That
this really was the way not to deliver my felf, but
entirely to ruin and deftroy my felf > for unlefs I was
fore to kill every one that not only fhould be on
Shore at that Time, but that fhould ever come on
Shore afterwards, if but one of them efcap'd, to tell
their Country People what had happen'd,they would
come over again by Thoufands to revenge the
Death of their Fellows, and I fliould only bring up^
on my felf a certain Deftru&ion, which at prefent
J had no manner of Occafion for.
. Upon the whole I concluded, that neither in
Principles nor in Policy, I ought one Way or other
to concern my felf in this Affair. That my Bufinefs
was by all poffible Means to conceal my felf from
them, and not to leave the leaft Signal to them tp
guefs by, that there were any living Creatures upon
the Ifland ; I mean of humane Shape.

Religiorf jpin'd in with this Prudential, and I was
convinc d now many Ways, that I was perfje&ly out
ef my Duty, . when I was laying all my bloody
Schemes for the Deftnjftion of innocent Creatures,
I mean innocent as to me ; As to the Crimes they
were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them ; they. were national, and I ought
to leave them to the Juflice of God, who is the Go-
vernour of Nations, apd knows how by national
Punifhments to make a juft Retribution for national
Offences ; and . to bring publick Judgments upoq
thofe who offend in a publick Manner, by fuch
Ways as beft pleafcs him.

• This appear'd fo clear tQ me now, th*t nothing
$ras a greater Satisfaction to me, than that I had
not been fuffer'd to do a Thing which I now fa,w
(o much Reafon to believe would have been no lefs
a Sin, than that of wilful Murder, if I had com-

muted






[ 2,05 ]

mitted it ; and I gave moft humble Thanks on my
Knees to God, that had thus delivered me from
Blood-guiltinefs ; befeeching him to grant me the
Prote&ion of his Providence* that I might not fall
into the Hands of the Barbarians > or that I might
not lay my Hands upon them, unlefs I had a mate
clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my
own Lite.

• In this Difpofition I continued for near a Yeac
after this ,• and fo far was I from defiring an Oc-
casion for falling upon thefe Wretches, that in all
that Time I never once went up the Hill to fee
whether there were any of them in Sight, or to
know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to re-
new any of my Contrivances againft them, or be
provoked by any Advantage which might prefent it
felf to fall upon them ; only this I did, I went and
temoved my Boat, which I had on the other Side
the Ifland, and carried it down to the Eaft-End of
the whole Ifland, where I ran it into a little Cove
which I found under fome high Rocks, and where
I knew, by reafon of the Currents, the Savages
durft not, It leaft would not come with their Boats^
upon any Account' whatfoever.

With my Boat I carried away every Thing that
I had left there belonging to her, tho* not neceflary
for the bare going thither, viz. A Maft and Safl
which I had made for her, and a Thing like an An-
chor, but indeed which could not be call'd cither
Anchor .or Grapling ; however, it was the beft f
could make of its kind : All thefe I removed, that
there might not be the leaft Shadow of any Difco-
very, or any Appearance of any Boat, or of any
humane Habitation upon the Ifland.

Befides this, I kept my felf, as I faid, more re-
tired than ever, and feldom went from my Cell, o-

ther



t"*3



ther thin upda my conftant Employment, vii. To
milk my She-Goats, and manage my little Flock, in
the Wood ; which, as it was quite on the 6ther Part
pf the Ifland, was quite out of Danger ; fbr certain
it is* that thefe favage People, who fometime*
haunted this Ifland,never came with any Thoughts
of findipg any Thing here ; and confequently never
tarandred off from the Coaft ; and I doubt not, but
they might have been feveral Times on Shore, aftet
jny .Apprehenfions of them had made me cautious
as. well as before ; and indeed, I look'd back with
fome Horror upon the Thoughts of what my Con-
dition would have been, if I had chop'd upon them/
and been difcovered before that, when naked and
unarm'd, except with one Gun, and that loaden of-
ten only with fmall Shot, I walk'd every where
peeping, and peeping about the Ifland, to fee what
I could get ; wh*t a Surprize fhould I have been in*
if when I difcover'd the Print of a Man's Foot, I
had inftead of that feen fifteen or twenty Savages^
and found them purfuing me, and by the Swifbe&
of their Running, no Poffibility of my cfcaping
them.

The Thoughts of this fofnetimes funk my very
Soul within me, and diftrefs'd my Mind fo much,
that I could not foon recover it, to think what I
fijould have done, and how I not only (hould not
Jaave been able to refift them, but even fhould not
Jbave had Prefence of Mind enough to do what I
might have done ; much lefs, what now after fa
much Confideration and Preparation I might be
able to do : Indeed, after ferious thinking of thefe
Things, I fhould be very Melancholy,^ and fome-
times it would laft a great while ,• but I refolv'd it
at laft all into Thankfulness to that Providence,
-which had delivered me from fo many unfeen Dan-
gers, and had kept me from thofe Mifthiefs whiehr

J I could



I could no Way have been the Agent in delivering
mv felf from ; becaufe I had not the leaft Notion
ot any fuch Thing depending, or the leaft Suppo-
firion of it being poffible.

This renew'd a Contemplation, which often had
come to my Thoughts in former Time, when firft
I began to fee the merciful Difpofitions of Heaven,
in the Dangers we run through in this Life. How
wonderfully we are deliver'd, when we know ito-
thing of it. How when we are in (a Quandary, as
we call it) a Doubt or Hesitation, whether to go
this Way, or that Way, a fecret Hint (hall direfik
Us this Way, when we intended to go that Way ;
nay, when Senfe, our own Inclination, and perhaps
Bufinefs has call'd to go the other Way, yet a ftrange
Impreffion upon the Mind, from we know not what
Springs, and by we know not what Power, fhali
over-rule us to go this Way ; and it fhall afterwards
appear, that had we gone that Way which we Ihould
have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to
have gone, we fhould have been ruin'd and loft :
Uponthefe, and many like Reflexions, I after-
wards made it a certain Rule with mc, That when*
ever I found thofe fecret Hints, or Pffcflfogs erf my
Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thtrig that j>$&
fcnted ; or to going this Way, or that Way, 1 toera
fail'd to obey the fecret Di&ate ; though I knfewn£ ;
Other Reafon for it, than that fuch a Pfefliire, 0*^
ifuch a Hint hung upon my Mind : I could give m-%- V
ny Examples of the Succefs of this Condud in the
Courfe of my Life ; but more efpecially in the lat*
ter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Ifland ; be*
fides many Occafions which it is very likely I might
have taken Notice of, if I had feen with the fame
Eyes then, that I faw with now : But 'tis never too
late to be wife ; and I cannot but advife all consi-
dering Men, whofe Lives are attended with fuch ex-
traordinary



[ io8 ]

traordinary Incidents as mine, or- even though not
fo extraordinary, not to flight fudh fecret Intima-
tions of Providence, let them come froip what invifi J
ble Intelligence they will, that I ffiall not difcuf^
and perhaps cannot account for ; but* certainly they
are a Proof of the Converfe of Spirits, and the fe-
fcret Communication between thofe embody'd, " ancj
thofe unembody'd ,* and fuch a Proof as can never
be withftood : Of which I fhall have occafion to
give fome very remarkable Inftances, in the Re-
mainder of my folitary Refidence in this difmal
Place.

I believe the ; Reader of this will not think

Itrange, if I corifefs that thefe Anxieties, thefe con-
ftant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that was
now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to
all the Contrivances that I had laid for my future
Accommodations and Conveniences. I had the
Care of my Safety, more now upon my Hands, than
that of my Food. I car'd not to drive a Nail, or
.chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noife I
fiiould make fliould be heard ; much lefs would 1
fire a Gun, for the fame Reafon ; and above all, I
was intolerably uneafy at making anyFire , left the
Smoak, which is vifible at a great jDiftance in the
JDay, fliould betray me ; and for this Reafon I re-
moved that Part of my Bufinefs which required Fire,
iuch as burning of Pots and Pipes, &c. into my
new Apartment in the Woods, where after I Had
been fome Time, I found, to my unfpeakable Confo-
lation, a mere natural Cave in the Earth, which
.went in a vaft way, and where, I dare fay, no Sa-
vage had been at the Mouth of it, would be fo har-
dy as to venture in, nor indeed would any Man
elle ; but one who, like me, wanted nothing fo much
as a fafe Retreat.

The

The Mouth of this Hollow wail At the fiotfoiq
of a great Rock, where, by mere Accident ( I
would fay, if 1 did not fee abundant Reafon to a-
fcribe all fuch Things now to Providence) I Was
cutting down fome thick Branches of Trees i to
make Charcoal ,• and before I go on, I muft obferve
the Reafon of mjr nuking this Charcoal ; which
Was thus :

I was afraid of making a 8moak about my Ha-
bitation, as I faid before ; and yet I could not live
there without baking my Bread, cooking my Meat;
&c. fo I contrived to bum fome Wood here, as I
had feen done in England under Turf* till it became
Chark, or dry Coal ; and then putting the Fire out*
I preferv'd the Coal to carry Home, and perform
the other Services which Fire was wanting for at
Home, without Danger of Smoak.

But this by the by. While I was cutting down
fome Wood here, I perceiv'd that behind a very
thick Branch of low Bru(h~wood* or Under-woocfc
there was a kind of hollow Place ; I was curidus to
look into it* and getting with Difficulty into the
Mouth of it, I foutod it was pretty large, that is to
fay, fuffieient for me to ftand upright in it* and per-
haps another with me ; but I muft confefs to youj I
made more Hafte out than I did in, when looking
further into the Place, and which was perfectly
dark, I faw tWo broad fliining Eyes of fome Crea-
ture, whether Devil or Man, I knew not, which
twinkled like two Stars, the dim Light from the
Cave s Mouth (hiding dire&ly in , and making the
Refleftioti.

. However, after fome Paufe, I recovered my felf,
and began to call my felf a thoufand Fools, and
tell my felf, that he that was afraid to fee the De-
vil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Ifland all
alone ; and that I durft to believe there was no-

thing in this Cave that was more frightful than my
felt" i upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up
a great Firebrand,, and in I rufli'd again, with the
Stick "flaming in my Hand; I'had not gone three
Steps, in, but I was almoft as much frighted* as I was
before ; for I heard a. very loud Sigh, like that of a
Man in fome Pain, and it was* followed by a broken
Noife, as if. of Words half exprefs'd, and then a
deep Sigh again : I ftep r d back, and was, indeed,
itruck with fuch a Srtrprize, that it- put me into a
cold Sweat ; and if I Had "had a Hat on my Head,
I will not anfwer for it, that my Haii 4 might not
have lifted' it off. But -ft ill plucking np my Spirits
as well as I could, and encouragmjg my felf a little,
with considering tha$ the Power and Prefence of
God was every where, and was able to proteft me;
upon this I ftep'd forward again, and by the Light .
of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my
Head; Ifaw lying on the Ground a moft monftrous
'frightful 'old He-gpat, juft making his Will, as we
fay, and gafping for Life, and dying indfeed of mere
old Age. •

I ftir'd him a little, to fee if I could get him out,
and he efl'ay'd to get up, but was not able to raife
hinifelf ; and I thought with my felf, he might even
lie there ; for if he had frighted me fo, he would
certainly fright any of the Savages, if any of them
fhould be fo hardy as to come in there, while he
had any Life in him.

I was now recover'd from my Surprize* and be-
gan to look round me, when I found the Cave was
but very fmall, that is to fay, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, ei-
ther round or iquare, no Hands having ever been
employ'd in making it, but thofe of mere Nature :
I obferv'd alfo, that there was a Place at the fur-
ther Side" of it, that went in further, but was fo

• I lew,



[ ZII-J

fc>w, that it requir'd me to cr&p.upon my Hands
ahd Knees to go into it, and Whither I went I knew
not ; fo having no Candle,: I gave it over for feme!
iTiffie ; but refolv'd to" Come* again the next Day
provided With Candles, and a Tinder-box, whichf
I had made Of the Lock of ond of thd Muskets, 4
With fome Wild-fite in the Pan.

Accordingly, the fiext Day Icaiiie provided With'
fix large Candles of my own making ; for I- mad£
Very good Candlesr now of GoatV Tallow ; and go-
ing into this low Place, I was obliged to creep upon
all Fours, as I havefaid, almoft ten Yards y which/
By the Way, I thought was a Venture bold enough^
confidef ing that t knew not how far it might go,'
riot what was beyond it. When I was got through
the Strait, I foiind the Roof rofe higher up, I be-
lieve near twenty Foot ; but never Was fuch a glo J
rious Sight feen in the Ifland,. I dare fay, a$ it was^
to look round the Sides and Roof of this Vault 01*
Cave ; the Walls reflefied a hundred thoufand
Lights to me from my two Candles ; what it was in
the Rock, Whether Diamonds, Or any other precis
ous Stones, or Gold, which I ratther fuppos'd it -w
be, I knew not.

The Place I Was in, wa$ a itfofl: delightful Ca-
nity, or Grotto, of its kind, as could be expe&ed.'
though perfectly dark i the Floor " was dry and
level, and had a fort of final! loofe Gravel upon
it, fo that there was no nanfeous or venomous
Creature to be feen, neither Was there any Damp
or Wet on the Sides or Roof : The only Difficult
ty in it was the Entrance, which, however, as it
waS a Place of Security, and fuch a Retreat as I
wanted, I thought that Was a Convenience ; fo
that I was really rejoic'd at the Difcovery, and re-
folv'd, without any Delay, to bring feme of thofe
Things which I was moil anxious about to thi*

P a Platfr t



Cm]

Place ; particularly, I refolv'd to bring hither *y
Magazine of Powder, and all mv fpare Arms, vit.
Two Fowling-Pieces, (for I haa three in all) and
three Muskets, (for of them I had eight in all ; fo
I kept at my Caffle only five, which flood ready-
mounted, like Pieces of Cannon, on my outmoft
Fence ; and were ready alfo to take out upon any
Expedition.

Upon this Occafion of removing my Ammuni-
tion, I took Occafion to open the Barrel of Pow-
der which I took up ©at of the Sea, and which had
been wet > and I found that the Water had pene-
trated about three or four Inches into the Powder
on every Side, which caking and growing hard, had

Jreferv'd the infide like a Kernel in a Shell ; & that
had near fixty Pounds of very good Powder in die
Centre of the Cask, and this was an agreeable Dis-
covery to me at that Time ; Co I carry Y d all away
thither, never keeping above two or three Pounds
of Powder with me in my Caftle, for fear of a Sur-
prize of any Kind : I alfo carry M thither all the
Lead I had left for Bullets.

I fanc/d my felf now like onfe of the ancient Gi~
ants, which were faid to live m Caves and Holes
in the Rocks, where none could come at them ; for
I perfuaded my felf, while I was here, if five hun-
dred Savages were to hunt me, they could never
find me out ; or if they did, they would not ven-
ture to attack me here.

. The old Goat, who I found expiring, dy'd in
the Mouth of the Cave, the next Day after I made
this Difcovery ; and I found it much eafier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover
him with Earth, than to drag him out : So I
interrd him there, to prevent Offence to my Nofe.

I was

. I was now in my twenty-third Year of Refi-
4ence in this Ifland, and was To naturalized to th*
Place, aad to the Manner of Living! that could
I have but enjoy'd the Certainty, that no Savages
would come to the Place to qtfturb me, I could
have been content to have capitulated for /pending
the reft of my Time there, even to th$ laft Mo-
ment, till I had laid me down and d vM, like the old
Goat in the Cave. 1 had alio arriv d to fome little
DiverfiQns and Amufements, which made the Time
pafs more pleafantly yrith me a great deal, than
ft did before ; as firft, I had taught my Po# y as I
jjioted before, to fpeak ; and he did it fo familiarly,
and talk'd fo articulately and plain, that it was
yery pleafant to me : and he livM with me no U&
than fix and twenty Years. How long he might
live afterwards, I know not ; tho* I know they
Jiave a Notion in the Brafils, that they live a hun-
dred Years ; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there
jttill, calling after Poor Robin Crufoe to this Day. I
wifh no Un$UJhman the ill Luck to come there and
Jiear him ; but if he did, he would certainly believe
it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleafant
and loving Companion to me for no lefs than fix-
teen Year* of my Time, and then dv'd of mere
old Age ; as for my Cats, they multiply d, as I have
obferv d, to that Degree, that I was obliged to (boot
jeveral of them at firft, to keep them from devour-
ing me and all I had; but at length, when the
two old ones, I brought with me, were gone, and
after fome Time continually driving them from m4,
and letting them have no Provifion with me, they
all ran wild into the Woods, except two or throe
Favourites, which I kept tanie ; and whofe Young,
when they had any, I always drowned ; and thefe
were Part of my Family. Befides thefe, I always
. kept two or three hpufhold Kids about me, which I

P 3 taught



taught to feed out of my Hand ; and I ha4 two
jnore Parrots whi^h talk'd pretty well, and would all
call Robin Crufoe, but none like mjr firft ,• nor, indeed^
did I take the Pains with any of them that I had
flone with him. 1 had" alfo feveral tame Sea-Fowls;
whofe Names I know not, who I caught upon the
Shore, and cut their Wings ; and the little Stakes
which 1 had planted before my Caftle-Watl being
cow grown up to a good thick Grove, thefe Fowls all
liv'd among thefe low Trees, and bred there, which
Was very agpeeable to me j fo that, as I faid above,
I began to b? very well eofttented with the Life I
led, if it might but Jiave been fecund from the
Dread of the Savages. .

But it was otherwife direfted ; and it may not be
amifs for all People who fliall meet with my Story,
to make this juft Obfervation frofn it, viz,. How
frequently, in the Courfe of our Lives, the Evil
which in itfelf we feek moft to {hun, and which,
.when we are fallen into, is the moft dreadful to us,
is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our Deli-
verance, by which alone we can be rais'd again from
the Affliftion we are fallen into. ' I could give many
Examples of this in the Courfe of my unaccountable
.Life ; but in nothing was it more particularly re-
markable than in the Circumftances of toy laft Year a s
folitary Refidence in this Ifland.

Ic was now the Month of December, as I faid a-

bove> in my twenty-third Year ; and this being the

, fouthern §olftice, for Winter I cannot call it, was

the particular Time of my Harveft, and required

my being pretty much abroad in the Fields ,• when

going out pretty early in the Morning, even before

: it was thorpw Day-light, I was furpriz'd with fee-

. ing a Light- pf fqme Fire upon the Shore, at a Di-

.'ftanccfrojn me, of about two Miles, towards the

.£jid of the Ifland, where I had Obferv'd fome Sa-

^ vages



[ M5 ]

vagfcs had been, as before, but not on" the other
Side ; but, to my great Aflliftion, it was on my
Side of the .Ifland. , „

I was, indeed,. terribly furpriz'dat the.Sight, and
flep'd fhort within my Grove, not daring to go
out, left I might be furpr iz'd ; and yet I had no
more Peace within, from. f.h£ Apprehenfions. J had,
that. if thefe Savages, in rambling over the Ifland,
fhould find my Corn ftanding, or cut, or any of my
Works and Improvements^ the;y Would immediate- .
ly conclude, that there were People in the Place,
and would then never give over till they had found
me out : In this Extremity I went back direftly to ,
my Caftle, pull'd up the Ladder after me, and j&ade
all Things without look as wild and natural as I
could.

Then I prqpar'd my felf within, putting -giy feif,
in a Pofture of f Defence j I .loaded all my. Cannop,
as I call'd them; that is to fay, my Muskets, which -_
were mounted upon my jiew Fortificatiqn, and all J> *
my Piftols, and refolv'd to defend my. iejf to the.
laft Gafp, not forgetting fcrioufly to coipra<md.my
felf to the divine Prbte&opj.an4earneftry J tp ! pra7'
to God to deliver -me. out of the Hands of theJBar«
barians.,- ;andin this Pofture I con.tinu'd about two
Hours, but began to be mighty impatient for In-
telligence abroad, for I load no Spies \o feW put.

After fitting .a while longer, ai}d . mufiiig * what I
fhould do in this Cafe, J was not able ro bear fit-
ting in Ignorance any longer; ■ fc - fetting • up my
Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a
flat Place, as I obferv'd before, and then pulling
the Ladder up after me,. I fee it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hill ; and pulling. out
my Profpe&ive-Glafs, which I had taken on Pur-
pofe, I laid me down flat on my Eelty on the
Ground, and began to look for the Place. I pre-

P 4 fently



[«<3

fcntly found there was no lets than nine naked Sin
vages fitting round a fmall Fire, they had made, no?
to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
Weather being extream hot ; but, as I fuppos'd, to
drefs fome of their barbarous Diet of humane Flefh,
whifh they had brought with them, whether alive
or dead, I could not know.

They had two Comes with them, which they had
haled up upon the Shore ; and as it was then Tide
of Ebb, they Jeem'd to me to wait for the Reton}
of the Flood, to go sway again ; it is not eafy to
imagine what Confufion this Sight put me into,.
efpeciaUy feeing them come on my Side the Ifland,
and (o near me too * but when I obfav'd theic
coming muft be always with the Current of the Ebb, .
I began afterwards to be more fedate in my Mind*
being fetisfy'd that I might go abroad with Safety
^11 the Time of the Tide of Flood , if they were
not on Shore before : And having made this Obi.
iervation, I went abroad about my Harveft Wori;
with the more Compose,

As I cxpeftcd, fo it prov'd ,• for as foon as the
Tide made to the Weftward, I few them all take
Boat, and row (or paddle, as we call it) at) away i
l (hould have obferv'd, that for an Hour and more
before they went off, they went to dancing, and \
could eafily diforn their Poftures and Geftures by.
my Glaffef : I could- not perceive, by my niceft Ob-
fervatiori^ but that they were ftapk naked, and had
not the lcaft Covering upon them ; but whether they
were Men or Women, th^t I could not diftinguifh.

As foon as I law them ihip'd and gone, I took
two Guns uppn my Shoulders, and two Piftols at
jny Girdle, and my great Sword by my Side, with?
pot a Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able
fo make, * went away to the Hill, where I had dU 1

coverVJ



gover'd the firft Appearance of all ; and as foon as.
I gat thither, which was not lefs than two Hours,
(for I could not go apace, being fo loaden with Arms
#s I was) I perceiv'd there had been three Canoes
more of Savages on that Place ; and looking out
further, I faw they were all at Sea together, making
over for the Main.

This was a dreadful Sight to me, efpecially when
going down to the Shore, I could fee the Marks o£
Horror which the difmal Work they had been about,
had left behind it, viz,. The Blood, the Bones, and.
Fart of the Flefli of humane Bodies, eaten and de-.
vour'd by thofe Wretches, with Merriment and'
Sport : I was fo fill'd with Indignation at the Sigfy,
that I began now to premeditate the Deftru&ion ot
the next that J faw there, let them be who or how.
piany foever.

Jt feem'd evident to me, that the Vi/its which-
they thus make to this Ifland, are not very frequent ;.
for it was above fifteen Months before any more of
them came on Shore there again ; that is to fay, I
neither faw them, or any Foot&eps, » or Signals of
them, in all that Time ,- for as to the rainy Sea-,
ions, then, they are fare not to . come abroad, at
leaft not fo far ; yet all this while I liv'd uncomfort-
ably, . by reafon of the conilant Apprehenfious I was
in of their coming upon me by Surprize ; from
whence I obferve, that the Expeftation of Evil is
pu>re bitter than the Suffering, efpecially if there is
no Room to fh^jte off that Expectation, or thofe
Apprehenfions.

During all this Time, I was in the murdering
Humour ; and took up moil of my Hours, which
(hould have been better employed irf contriving
hpw to. circumvent and fall upon SsNem the very
next Time I (hQuld fee them ,- especially, if they
ftoulji be divided, as they were the fall Time, in-
to



to two Parties ; nor did I confider at all, that if I
kiird one Party, fuppofe Ten or a Dozen, I was Hill-
the next Day, or Week, orMottfh, to kill another,
and fo another, even ad infinitum, till I fhould bd ac :
length no lefs a Miijrderer than they were in being
Man-eaters, and perhaps much* more fo.

I fpent my Days now in great Perplexity an3
Anxiety of Mind, expe^ing* that I fhould one Day f
or other fell into the Hands- of riiefe'mercilefs Crea- {
tqres; and if I did at any Time -venture abroad, it t
vfras not without looking round in c ;with the great-
eft Care and Caution imaginable;: &hd now I found
tty'my great Comfort, how- fctppy * it was that I
provided for .a tame Fldck or Herd of Gcats> for
I durft noty upon any Account, fire my Gun, efpe-
ciafly near that Side of the-Iflarid where they ufu-
ally came, left I ftiQuld alarm the Savages; and
if they had fled from me now, I was fure to have
them come -back again, witli perhaps twb or- three
hundred Comes with them in a few Days, and then
I knew what to expeft.

However, I wore out a Year and three Months
more, before I ever faw any more of the Savages,
and then I found them again, as'I fliall foon obferve.
It is true, they might have be^n there once or twice ;
but either they made no Stay, or at leaft, I did nor
hfear them ; but in the Month of May y as near as I
could calculate; and in my four and twentieth Year,
I had a very ftrange Encounter with them, of which
in its Place. .*...,-■

The Perturbation of my Mipd, during this fi£
teen or fixteeri Months Interval, was very great ;
I flept unquiet, dreamt always frightful Dreams,
and often ftarted out of my Sleep in the Night: In
the Day great Troubles overwhelmed my Mind,
and in the Night I dreamt often of killing the

Savages,



Savages, afwt jof the Reafbns why : I might juftify;
the doing of ir;:»But to wave all this for a : whilei-
it was on the Middle of May, on the fixteenth Thj :
t think, as well as my poor wooden; Calendar' would
reckon f for- ft marked all. upon the Poft ftill ,• I fay,
it was tki the fixteenth of May, that it blew a very
great Storm of Wind, all Day,; with a great deal of
L'ightning'and Thunder, and a very foui Night it
was after it: I. know not what- was the particular
. Occafion of it; tout as I was reading in the, Bifcile,
and taken up with very ferious Thoughts about my
jfrtefent Condition* J* was furpm'd with a ^loifeof
a Gun, aslthdughfc, fir'datSea. ..

This was to toc'fure a Surprize of, a quite diffe-,
rent Nature from. any I had met with before .$ for
the Motions this put into my .Thoughts were, quite
of another kind/' I'ftarted up in the[gfeateft,Hafte
imaginable, and.itt'a trice clapt my. Ladder to the
fiiiddle Place ;of the- Rock, and pultfd it after me,
and* mounting it ih£ fecortd Tiiae,; gp? to the Top
of the Hill, the very. Moment that a Flafe of Fire
bid me liften for & lecond Gun;, whicfe accordingly,
in about half a Minute, IJieacd^and by the Souncf
knew that it\y as; from that Part of.ih? Sea, where X
was driven down the Current in my Boat.
-I immediately. confider'd that thjs ijnjft be fome
Ship in Diftrefs,. and that . they, had .ferae Comrade,
or fome other Ship in Company, and .fix d thefe Guns
for Signals of Diftrefs, and to obtain Help : I had
this Prefence of Mind at that Minute, as to think
that: though I. could not help theip^it; may be- they
might help me ; fa I brought together all the
dry Wood I could, .get at hand, and making a £po<l
handfome Pile, I.iet it on Fire upon the Hill; ^e
Wood was dry, and: blafc'd freely -, a?pd thougix.tlip'
Wind blew.. very hard, yet it burnt fairly out ;. ttaf,
J was certain, if there was 4ny fuch .Thing as *

^ ., .» Ship,



Ship, they mud needs fee it, and no doubt they did j
for as foon as ever my Fire blaz'd up f I heard ano-
ther Gun, and after that feveral others, all from the
fame Quarter. I pl/d my Fire all Night long, till
Day broke ; and when it was bread Day, and the
Ait cleared up, I fa w fometbing at a great Diftance
at Sea, full Eaft of the Ifland, whether a Sail, or a
Hull, I could not diftinguifb, no not with my Gaf-
fes, the Diftance was fo great, and the Weather
ftiil fomcthing hazy alfo ; at leaft it was fo out
at Sea.

I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and (oon
perceiv'd that it did not move ; fo I prefently con*,
duded that it was a Ship at an Anchor ; and being
eager, you may be Aire, to be fatisfy'd, I took my
Gun in my Hand, and run toward the Sowb-Eafl
Side of the Ifland, to the Rocks where I bad
formerly been carry 'd away with the Current, and
getting up there, the Weather by this Time being
perfe&y clear, I could plainly fee, to my great Sor-
row, the Wreck of a Ship <*ft away in the Night,
upon thofe concealed Rocks which I found when I
was out in my Boat ; and which Rocks, as they
check'd the Violence of the Stream, and made a
kind of Counter-Stream or Eddy, were the Occa*
fion of my recovering from the moft defperate hope-
lefs Condition that ever I had been in in all my Life;

Thus, what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's
Deftru&ion ; for it feems thefe Men* whoever they
were , being out of their Knowledge , and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven
upon them in the Night, the Wind blowing hard at
£. and E.N,E. Had they feen the Ifland, as I muft
neceflkrily fuppofe they did not, they muft, as I

Imaein'cl, my Fire, fittM me with many Thoughts :
Fitft I imagin'd, that upon feeing my Light, they
might have put themfelves into their Boat, and

•have endeavQur'd to make the Shore ; but that the
Sea going very high, they might have been caft
away ; other times I imagin'd, that they might
have loft their Boat before, as might be the Cafe
many ways ; as particularly, by the Breaking of
the Sea upon their Ship, which many times obfi-

' ees Men to ftave , or take in Pieces their Boat ; and
fometimes to throw it over Board with their own
Hands : Other times I imagin'd, they had fome
bther Ship or Ships in Company, who, uJ>on the
Signals of Diftrefs they had made, had taken dtehi
up, and carr/d them off: Other whiles I farfc/d,
they were all gone off to Sea in their Boat, and
being hurry'd away by the Current that I had been

* formerly in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean,
where there was nothing but Mifefy and Perifhing ;
and that perhaps they might by this Time think bf
Starving, and of being in a Condition to eat o?e
another.

As all thefe were but Conje&tires at beft, fo in the
Condition I was in, I could do no more than look
on upon the Mifery of the poor Men, and pity
them, which had ftill this gbod Efieft on my Side,
that it gave me more and more Caufe to give
Thanks to God, who had fo happily and comfort-
ably provided for me in my defblate Condition ,- and
that of two Ships Companies who were now caft
away upon this Part of the World, not one Life
Ihould be fpar'd but mine : I leatn'd here again to
obferve, that it is very rare that the Provioence of
God cafts us into any Condition of Life fo low, or
any Mifery fo great, but we may fee fomething or
other to be thankful for ; and may fee others in
worfe Ctrcumftances than our own.

Such certainly was the Caie of : thejfe ■ Men, of
whom I could not fo much a$ fee Room tofup-
pofe any of them were fav'd; nbthing could mike
it rational, fo much as to with or exped that thqy
did not all perifti there, except the Poffibility only
of their being taken up by another Ship in Com-
any ; and this w&s but mere Poffibility .indeed ; for
law not the leaft Signal or Appearance of any
fuch Thing.

I cannot explain, by any poffible Energy of Words,
what "a #rangs" Lorigiug or Hankering o( Defires;I
felt 111 my Sopl upon this Sight, (.breaking out fomp-

. .tiihes thus j O' that there had been but one or twq;
P4y, Qrblit one Soui/av'd out of this Ship, to have
efcap'J to me, that I might but have had one Com-
panion,, one Feljow-Creature to havefpoken tome,

".arid to hive conver$*d with ! In all the Time of my
foiitary Life, Tneyfct felt fo earneft, fo ftrong a De-
fceafiter the Society of my Fellow-Creatures, or fo
deep a Regret at the Want of it.

There are fome £cret moving Springs in the Af-

" Jefrioris, which when they are fet a going by fbme
Obje& in View, or be it fome Objeft, though n6t
in View, yet rendered prefent to the Mind by the
Power of Imagination, that Motion carries out the
Soul by its Impetuofity to fach . violent eager Em-
bracings of the'Objeft, that the Abfence of it is
infupportable.

Such were thefe earneft Wifcings, .That tut fine
Man had been fav'd ! O that it fycid been but One ! I
believe I repeated the Words , O that it bad been tut
One I a thoufand Times ;'and the Ifefires were fo
mov'd by it, that when I fpoke the Words, xfiy
Hands would clinch together, and my Fingers prefs
the Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any foft
Thing "in my Hand, it would have crufli'd it inyo-
liuirarily ;" and my Xeeth in my Head would ftrike

together,



[ 1IJ ]

together, find : fet againft one another ' fo ftrop$
that for fome Time I doi^ld not part them again. t
- Let. the Naturalifts, explain thefe Things, and
the Reafon and Manner of them ;. all I can fay tq
them is, to defcribe the Fad, which was even fur-
prifing to me when I found it ; tho* I knew not froty
what it fhould* proceed, it was doubtlefs the Efieft
of ardent Withes,, and of ftrong Ideas forxn'd in my
Mind, realizing the Comfort which ; the: Coqvesifrf
tion of one of my Fellow-Chriftiana would h^ye
been to. me. ,.- . . : ■,

/ Btit it was not to be ; either their Fate, or mine^
or both* forbid it j for till the laft ;Yea* of my k$*
ingL on this Ifland^ I never knew whether any were
fav'd out of that Ship or no ; and had only the Afr
fliftion fome Days after, to fee the Corps of ^
drown'd Boy come on Shore, at the End of the
liland, which was. next the Shipwreck : He had pa
no Cloachs, but a Seaman's Waftcoat, a Pair of open-
Jknee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blew Linnen Shirt ;
but nothing to ditfed me fo much as to guefs what
Nation he was. of : He had nothing in his Pocket
but two Pieces of Eight and a Tobacco-Pipe ; th?
laft was to me of tea times more Value than the
firft. .

It was now calm, and I had a great Mind to
venture out in my Boat to this Wreck ,• not doubl-
ing but I might find fomething on Board, thft
mighp be ufeful to me ; but that did not altogether
prefs me fo much, as the Poffibility that there
might be yet fome'living Creature og board, whole
Life I might not only fave, but might, by faving
that Life, comfort my own to the laft Degree ;
and this Thought clung fo to my Heart, that I
could not be quiet, Night nor Day, but I muft
venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck ; and
committing the reft to God s Providence, I thought

the



C"4]

the Impreflloo was (6 ftrong upon my Mind, tint
it could not be refilled, that it muft come from
fome invifible Dire&ion, and that 1 fhould be wan*
ting to myfdf, if I did not go.

Under the Power of this Impreffion, I haften'd
back to my Cattle, prepaid every Thing for my
Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot
for frefli Water, a Compafs to ftecr by, a Bottle of
Rum ; for I had Itill a great deal of that left ; a.
Basket full of Raiilns : And thus loading myfclf
with every Thing neceflary, I went down to my
Boat, got the Water out of her, and got her afloat,
loaded all my Cargo in her, and then went Home
again for more ; my fecond Cargo was a great Baft
full of Rice, the Umbrella to fet up over my Head
for Shade, another large Pot foil of frefli Water,
and about two Dozen of my fmall Loaves, or
Barley Cakes, more than before, with a Bottle of
Goat s Milk, and a Cheefe ; all which, with great
Labour and Sweat, I brought to my Boat ; and
praying to God to direft my Voyage, I put out,
and rowing or paddling the Canoe along the Shore,
I came at laft to the uthioft Point of the Ifland
on that Side, (viz,.) N. E. And now I was to launch
out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to venture. I took'd on the rapid Currents which
ran constantly on both Sides of the Ifland, at a
xHftance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been
in before, and my Heart began to fail me ; for I
forefaw that if I was driven into either of thofe
Currents, I (hould be carry'd a vaft Way out to
Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach, or Sight rf
the Ifland again ; and that then, as my Boat was
but fmall, if any little Gale of Wind fcould rife, I
(hould be inevitably loft.

C *i* ]

Thefc Thoughts fo opprefs'd my Mind, that I
began to give over my Enterprize, and having ha-
led my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I
fiept out, and fate me down upon a little rifirig
Bip of Ground, very penfive and anxious, between
Fear and Defirfe about my Voyage ; when,as I was
raufing, I could perceive that the Tide was turn'd
and the Flood came on, upon which my going was
for fo many Hours impra&icable. Upon this
prefently it occur'd to me, that I fhould gt> up to
the higheft Piece of Ground I could find, and ob-
serve, if I could, how thfc Sets of the Tide or Cur-
rents lay, when the Flood came in, that I might
judge whether, if I Was driven one Way out, I might
not exped to bt driven another Way Home, with
the fame Rapidnefs of the Currents : This
.' Thought was no fooner in my Head* but I caft my
' Eye upon a little Hill, which diffidently over-
. looked the Sea both Ways, atid from whence I had
" a clear View of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide,
] ted Which Way I was to guide my felf in niy Re-
turn ; here I found, that as the Current of the Ebb
fet out clofe by the South Point of the Ifland, fo
the Current of the Flood fet in dofe by the Shore
of the North Side, and that I had nothing to do
but to keep to the North of the Ifland in riy Re-
turn, and I fiiould do well enough.

Encourag'd with this Obfervation, I refolv'd the
next Morning to fet out with the firft of the Tide ;
and repofing my felf for the Night in the Canoe,
under the great Watch-coat 1 mentioned, I launched
out : I made firft a little out to Sea full North, till
I began to feel the Benefit of the Current, tfrhfeh fet
fcaftwafd, and which carry'd me at a great Rate,
and yet did not fo hurry me as the Southern Side
Current had done before, and fo as to take from
me all Government of the Boat ; but having a

(^ ftrong



ftrong Steerage with my Paddle, I went at a great
Rate, dire&ly for the Wreck, and in iefs than two
Hours I came up to it.

It was a difmal Sight to look at : The Ship,
which by its Building was Spanijb, ftuck faft,
jaum'd in between two Rocks ; all the Stern and
Quarter of her was beaten to Pieces with the Sea ;
and as her Forecaftle, which ftuck in the Rocks,
had run on with great Violence, her Mainmaft a&d
Forcmaft were brought by the Board ; that is to
fay, broken fliort off ; but her Boltfprit was found,
and the Head and Bow appealed firm ; when I
came clofe to her, a Dog appear'd upon her, who
feeing me coming, yelp'd and <iry*d, and as foon
as I call'd him, jumped into the§ba/to come to
me, and I took him into the Boat, bur found him
almoft "dead for Hunger and Thirft : I gave him a
Cake of my Bread, and he eat ir like a ravenous
Wolf, that had been ftarving a'Fortrtight in the
Snbw : I then gave the poor Creature fome fitfli
Water, with which, if I would Have let him, "he
would have burft himfelf.

After this I went on Board ; but the firft Sight
I met with, was two Kten drown'd in the Cbok-
Room, or Forecaftle of the Ship^ With their Artais
"faft about one another : I concluded, as is indeed
probable, that when the Ship ftruck, it being in a
Storm,' the Sea broke fo high, and fo continually
over her, that the Men were not able to bear it,
and were ftrangled with the conftant milling in of
the Water, as much as if f they had been under Wa-
tef. Uelides the'bog, there was nothing left in
the $hip ! that' had Life;' nor any Goods that I
could fee, but what were fpoiTd'by the Water.
There were fome Casks of Liquor, whether Wine
or Brandy, I knew not, which lay leaver in the
Hold ; and which, the Water" being ebVd' out, I

could



fcduld fee ; byt they; were too big fo meddle with :
I fa* fevetal CheR^ : ;wfiicIv 1 bclievM belong'd tb
fome of the Seamen, anil I ' £bt tfao^of them into
the Boat, without examining ^at was in them.

Had the Stern ,of the Ship. Jbeeft fik'd; and the

Forepart broken off^ I zp. perftfaded I might have

irijde a good Voyage J' for by what I found in- th'efe

\ two Chefts,' I had J^bom to fuppcrfe the Ship had

. a "great deal of Wekfth on Board ; and 'if I miy

guefs by the Coutfc'fhe fleer d, flie muft have been

bound from the Bu&ios Ayres, or theTlfo de la Plata,

' in the South' Part of America, beyond the Bmjtls,

\.to the fcavana, in the Gulph of Mexico, and fopdr-

haps to Spain: 5he hUd, no Dbnbt, a great Treafarc

in.her, bus of noTJfe at that'Tiine to any Body ;

and what became 6( the reft of her People, I then

knew not.

' I found, beffdes thefe Chefts, a 1 little Cask foil of
Liquor, of about'.twepty Gallons, which I got into
xny Boat, with miich Difficulty ; there were feveral
Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-hornjwith
about four Pounds of Powder in it ,• as for the Mus-
Jcets, I had no Occafion for them, fo I left them,
but took the Powder-horn : I took a Fire-fliovel and
'Tongs, which I wanted extremely; as alfo two
little Brafe-Kettles, a Gipper Pot to make Choco-
late, and a Gridiron ; and with this Cargo, and the
Dog, I camp away, the Tide beginning to make
Home again; and the fame Evening, about an
Hour within Night, I reach'd the Ifland again,
weary and fatigu d to the laft Degree.

I repos'd that Night in the Boat,and in the Morn-
ing Trefolv'd to harbour what I had gotten in my
new Cave, not to carry it Home to my Caftle. After
refrefhing myfelf, I got all my Cargo on Shore, and
began to examine the Particulars : The Cask of
Liquor I found to be a kind of Rum, but not fuch

Q 2 as



[ iz8 ]

as we had at the Brafils ; and in a tVbtd, not at
all good ; but when I came to open the Chefts, I
found feveral Things of great Ufe to me : For
Example, I found in one a fine Cafe of Bottles, of
an extraordinary Kind, ahd fillYf with Cordial Wa-
ters, fine, and very good ; the Bottles held about
three Pints each, and were tip'd with Silver : I
found two Pots of very good Succades, or Sweet-
meats,- fo faften'd alfo on Top, that the Salt Water
had not hurt them ; and two more of the feme,
which the Water had fpoiTcf » I found foifle very
good Shirts, which were very Welcome to me, and
about a dozen and a half of Linnen white Handker-
chiefs, and coloured Neckcloths ; the former were
alfo very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to
wipe my Face in a hot Day ; befides this, when I
came to the Till in the ChefU, I found there three
great Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about .
eleven hundred Pieces in all ; and in one of them,
wrapt up in a Paper, fix Doubloons of Gold, and
fome fmall Bars or Wedges of Gold » I fuppofe they
might all weigh near a Pound.

The other Cheil I found had fome Cloaths in it,
but of little Value ; but by the Circumfianccs it
rauft have belonged to the Gunner s Mate, though
there was no Powder in it, but about two Pounds of
fine glaz'd Powder, in three fmall Flasks, kept, I
fuppofe, for charging their Fowling-pieces on Oc-
cafion : Upon the whole, I got very little by this
Voyage, that was of any Ufe to me; for as to the
Money, I had no Mapner of Occafion for it ; 'twas
to me as the Dirt under my Feet ,- and I would
have given it all for three or four Pair of Ettglijk
Shoes and Stockings, which were Things I greatly
wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for
many Years : I had, indeed, gotten two Pak of'
Shoes now, which I took off of the Feet of the

two



[»9l

two drbwn'd M"cn, who I &w in- thfe Wreck j and"
I ifound two Pair more in one of the Chefts, which
were very welcome to me ; hut they were not like
our Englijb Shoes, either for Eafe or Service, being
rather what we call Pumps than Shoes : I found
in this Seaman's Chcft about fifty Pieces of Eight
in Royals, but no Gold ; I fuppofe this belonged
to a poorer Man than the other, which feem'd to
belong to fome Officer.

. )Vell, however, I lugged this Money home to
my Cave, and laid it up, as I had .done that before,
which I brought from our own Ship >.but it was great
Pity, as I fai4, that the other Part of this Ship had
hbt come to my Share, for I am fatisfy'd I might
have loaded my Came feveral Times over with Mo-.
ney, which, if I had ever efcapM to England, would
have lain here fafe enough till I might have come
again and fetched it.

Having now brought all my Things on Shore,
and fecur'd them, J went back to my Boat, and
row'd or paddled her along the Shore jto her old
Harbour, where, I laid her up, and made the bell of
my Way to my old Habitation,, where I found
CTcry Thing fate and quiet ; fo I began to repofe .
aiyfelf, live after my old Fafhion, and take Care of
my Family Affeirs; and for a while, I liv'd eafy
enough ; pnly that I was more vigilant than I us'd
to be, looked out oftner, and did not go abroad fo.
much ; . and if at any Time I did itir with any Free-
dom, it was always to the Eaft Part of the Ifland,
wh$r? J was pretty well fajisfy'fi the Savages never
lame, and where I could go without fo many Pre-
cautions, and fuch a Load of Arms and Ammuni-
tion, as I always carry 'd with ma if I went the
other Way.

another 1 Voyage to the Wreck, tho' my Reafon
told me that there was nothing left there worth the
Hazard of my Voyage : Sometimes for a Ramble
one Way, fometimes ^another 5 and I believe verily,
if I had had the Boat that I went from Sallee in,
I (hould have ventur'd to Sea, ! Bound any where, I %

It was one of the Nights, in the rainy Seafon in
March, the four and twentieth Year of my firft fet>-

Jt i$ a$ impoffible as needlefs, to fet down th?
innumerable Crowd pf Thoughts that whirls
through that great Thorowfair of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time : I run over the
whple Hiftory of my Life in Miniature, or by
Abridgment, ?s I m?y call it, to my coming to this
Ifland; and alfo of (he Part pf my Life fince J
came to this Ifland, In my Reflexions upon the
{State of Vfiy Cafe, fince I came on 3hore on this
Iflapd, I was comparing the happy Pofture of my
Affairs, in the firft Tears of my Habitation here,
compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear, and Care,
which I had liv'd in ever fince I had feen the Print or
a Foot in the Sand ; not that I did npt believe th?
Savages Jiad frequented the Ifland even all the while,
and might have been feveral Hundreds of them at
Times on Shore there ; but I had never known it,
and was incapable of any Apprehenfions about it }
jny Satisfaction was perfeft, tho' my Danger was
the fame ; and I was as happy in not knowing my
Danger, as if J had neyer really been expps'd to if?
This furnifli'd my Thoughts with many very pro?
Arable Reflexions, and particularly this one, How
infinitely Good th^t rrpvidence is, whi?h has pro-
vided in its Government of Mankind fuch narrow
Bounds to his Sight and Knowledge of Things;
2nd tho' he walks in the midft of fo many thoufand
Dangers, the Sight of whifh, if difcover'd to him,
would diflr^ft his Mind, and fink his Spirits, he is
kept ferene £nd calm, by having the Events qf Things
hid from hi$ Eyes, and knowing nothing of the Dan-
gers which furrpund him.

After thefe Thpughts had fpr fome Time enter-
tained oje, I came to refled ferioufly upon the real
Danger I had b^pn in for (q many Tears in this

pr^tpft §ec*irit^ gnd with fill ppflible Trancjuilj*

ty ; even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a
Hill, a great Tree, or the cafual Approach of
Night, had been between me and the worft Kind
of Deftru&ion, viz. That of falling into the Hands
of Canibals and Savages, who would have feiz'd
on me with the fame View as I did of a Goat or
a Turtle, and have thought it no more a Crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon or a
Curlieu : I fhould Hnjuftly (lander myfelf, if I
fliould fay I was not fincerely thankful to my great
Preferver, to whofe fingular Prote&ion I acknow-
ledged, with great Humility, that all thefe un-
known Deliverances were due ; and without which
I muft inevitably fallen into their mercilefs Hands.

' When thefe Thoughts were over, my Head was
for fome time taken up in considering the Nature
of thefe wretched Creatures, I mean, the Savages;
and how it came to paft in the World, that the
wife Governour of ill Things fliould give up any
of his Creatures to fuch Inhumanity ,- nay, to fome-
thing fo much below even Brutality itfelf, as to
devour its own Kind ; but as this ended in fome
(at that Time fruitless) Speculations, it occur'4
to me to enquire, what Part of the World thefe
Wretches liv'd in ; how far off the Coaft was from
whence they came ; what th*y ventur'd over fo far
from Home for; what Kind of Boats they had;
and why I might not order myfelf, and my Bufi-
nefs fo, that I might be as able to go over thither,
as they were to come to me,

I never fo much as troubled myfelf to confide?
what I fhould do with myfelf when I came thi-

jny very Blood" into a- Ferment, and my Pulfe beat
as high as if I had been in a Fever, merely with
the extraordinary Fervour of my Mind about it;
Nature, as, if:. I had been fatigued ' and ; exhauited
with the very Thought of* it, threw ipe into a
found Sleep : One would have thought, I £houl4
have dreamt of it; but I did riot, nor of any
Thing relating to it ; but I dreamt, that as I, was

foing out in the Morning, as ufual, from my Caftle,;
faw upon^e Shore two Canoes, and eleven Sava-
ges coming to.Land > and that they brought witfr.
them another Savage, who they, were going to kil£
in order to eat him; when, on a fudden, the Sa-
vage, that they were going to kill, jump'd. away,
and ran for his life; and I thought in my Sleeps
that he came running into my little thick GrQve^
before my Fortification, to hide himfelf ,• and thai; I
feeing him alone* and not perceiving that the othejc
•fought him that Way, fliow'd myfelf to him>
■apd, fmiling upon him, encouraged him; that he
teieei'd down to .me, feeming to pray me tQ.afliJJ
film ; upon which I fliew'djny. Ladder, made him
go up, and carry 'd him intortfcy Cave, and he be-
came my Servant ; .and thatjas fooa as I had got-
ten .this Man, I faid to myfefl^ now. I may certain^-
iy .vventure to the Main Land ; for this Fellow
will ferve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to
do, : and" whither to go for Provifions; and.whi-
ttet not to -go for fear of being devout^ what Pla*
ccs. to venture into, and /what to efcipe 1 : I wak'jjl
with this Thought, snd.was under fuch inexprefr
iible Impreffiohs of Joy at the Profpeft of my Efcape
in my Dreaip, that the Difappointmcnts which I felt
jipon coming to myfelf, and finding it was op
jabre than a Dream, were equally extravagant the*

ether Way, and threw me into a very great Dejec^
tk>n of Spirit.

Upon this, however, I made this Conclusion,
That my only Way to go about an Attempt for an
Efcape, was, if poffible, to get a Savage into my
Pofl'effion ; and it poffible, it fhould be one of their
Prisoners, whom they had condemn'd to be eaten,
and fiiould bring thither to kill ; but thefe Thoughts
(till were attended with this Difficulty, that it was
impoffible to efled this, without attacking a whole
Caravan of them, and killing them all ; and this
was not only a very defperate Attempt, and might
mifcarry ; but, on the other hand, I had greatly
fcrupled the Lawfulnefs of it to me, and my Heart
trembled at the Thoughts of (bedding fo much
Blood, tho* it was for my Deliverance. I need
«iot repeat the Arguments which occur'd to mc
againft this, they being the fame mentioned before :
But tho' I had x)ther Reafons to offer now, (wsc)
that thofe Men were Enemies to my Life, and
would devour me, if they could ; that it was Self*
prefervation in the higheft Degree, to deliver my?
(elf from this Death of a Life, and was a&ing in
my own Defence, as much as if they were a&ually
afiaulting me, and tile like : I fay, tho' thefe Things
argued for it, yet the Thoughts of fhedding hu?
mane Blood for my Deliverance, were very terrible
to me, and fuch as I could by no Means reconcile
myfelf to a great while.

However, at laft, after many fecret Difputes
with myfelf, and after great Perplexities about
it, for all thefe Arguments, one Way and another,
ftruggled in my Head a lokg. Time, the eager pre-
vailing Defire of Deliverance at length mattered
all the reft, and I refolv'd, if poffible, to get one
pf thofe Savages into my Hands, coft what it

would.

would; My next Thing then was to contrive how
to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to re*
folve on. But as I could pitch upon no probable
M^ans for it, fo I refolv'd to put my felf upon the
Watch, to fee them when they came on Shore, and
leave the reft to the Event, taking fuch Meafures as
the Opportunity fhould prefent, let be what would
be.

With thefe Refolutions in my Thoughts, I fet
my felf upon the Scout, as often as poffible, and
indeed fo often till I was heartily tir d of it ; for
it was above a Year and a half that I waited, and
for great part of that Time went out to the Weft
End, and to the South Weft Corner of the Ifland,
almoft every Day, to fee for Canoes, but none
appeared. This was very difcouraging, and began
to trouble me much ; though I can't fay that it did
in this Cafe, as it had donefome Time before that,
(viz*.) wear off the Edge of my Defire to the Thing.
But the longer it feem'd to be delay'd, the more
eager I was for it ; in a word, I was not at firft fo
careful to fhun the Sight of thefe Savages, and
avoid being feen by them, as I was now eager to
be upon them.

Befides, I fcney'd my felf able to manage one,
nay, two or three Savages, i£ I had them, fo as to
make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever
I fhould direft them, and to prevent their being
able at any Time to do me any Hurt. It was a
great while that I pleas'd my felf with this Affair,
but nothing ftill prefented ; all my Fancies and
Schemes came to nothing, for no Savages came near
me for a great while.

About a Year and half after I had entertained
thefe Notions, and, by long muling, had as it were
refolv'd them all into nothing, for want of an Oc-
cafion to put them in Execution, I was furpriz'd

one



one horning early, with feeing no lefs than five
Canoes all on Shore together on my Side the Ifland ;
and the People who belong'd to them all landed,
and out of my Sight : The Number of them broke
all my Meafures ; for feeing fo many, and know-
ing that they always came four or fix, or fometimes.
more, in a Boat, I could not tell what to think of
it, or how to take my Meafures, to attack twen>
ty or thirty Men fingle handed ; fo I lay ftiil in
my Caftle, perplexed and difcomforted : However
I put my felf into all the fame Poftures for an At-
tack, that I had formerly provided, and was juft
ready for A&ion, . if any Thing had prefented, Ha«
ving waited a good while, liftening to hear if they
made any Noife; .at length, being very impatient
I fet my Guns at the Foot of my Ladder, and
clamber'd up to thp Top of the Hill, by my two
Stages, as ufua\ ,• ftanding fo, however, that my
Head did not appear above the Hill fo that
they could not perceive me by. any Means : Here
I obferv'd, by the Help of my PerfpeAive Glafs,
that they were no lefs than thirty in Number, that
they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat
drefs'd ; how they had cook'd it, that I knew not,
or ,what it was ; but they were all dancing in I
know not how ijiany barbarous Geflures and Fi-
gure^ their own Way, round the Fire*

While I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my Perfpe&ive two miferable Wretches drag'd
from the Boats, where it feems they were laid by,
and were now brought out for the Slaughter. I
: perceived one of them immediately fell, being
knock'd down, I fuppofe with a Club or Wooden
'Sword, for that was their way, and two or three
others were at Work, immediately cutting him open
for their Cookery, while the other Viftira was left
ftanding by himfelf, till they fhould be . ready for

him.



"liim. In that very Moment this poor Wretch fee-
ing himfelf a little at Liberty, Nature infpir'd him
-with Hopes of Life, and he itarted away from
them, and ran with incredible Swiftnefs along the
Sartds direftly towards me, I mean, towards that
part of the Coaft where my Habitation was.
I was dreadfully frighted (that I muft acknow-
ledge) when I perfcelVci him to ruh toy Way ; and
cfpecialty, whcn ; asl thotightr I few him purfued
by the whole Body ; and now I expe&ed that Part
* of my Dream was coming to pafs,' and that he
yoiHd certainly t^kfe 'Shelter in my Grove,- but I
could not depend by any me&ns tipon my- Dream
for* the reft of : it, (viz,.) that- the other Savages
Wiild not purfue him : thither, and -find hifti there.
However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began
to'recfcver, when I found that there was not above
threfc Mfcn that foflow'd him ,• and ftill more was I
encoftrag'd, when I found that he - outftript them
"exceedingly in -hinnitig, and gain'd Ground of them,
fo that if he could but hold it for half an Hour,
; I faw'eaiily fed/ wt>tild fairly get away from them
all.-' " ' ,Xi v • ■ . :. .

There was ' Between them and itty Caftle the
Gre^k which- I'mentionM often at the* firft Part -of
inyStory^wheh^ Handed my Cargoes out of the
Ship • -and this, T few plainly, he muft neceflarily
fwihi over, or the poor Wretch would be taken
there : But wh6n the Savage efcaping came thi-
ther, he made nothing of it y though the Tide was
thfen up, but plunging in, fwam thro* in about
thirty Stokes, • or thereabouts, landed, and ran on
^ijh exceeding -Strength and Swiftnefs ; when the
three Perfons eame to the Creek, I found that
two of them could fwim, but the. third could not,
and that {landing on the other Side, he look'd at
the 6ther, but went no farther; and foo& after went ,

foftly



[*4° 3

foftly back again, which, as it happened, was very
well for him in the maim

I obferv'd, that the two who fwam, were yet
more than twice as long fwimming over the Creek,
as the Fellow was that fled from them : It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed
irrefiftibly, that now was my Time to get me a
Servant, and perhaps a Companion, or Affiftant*
and that I was ealTd plainly by Providence to fave
this poor Creature's Life ; I immediately run down
the Ladders, with all poffible Expedition, fetched
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot
of the Ladders, as I obferv'd above ; and getting
up again, with the fame Hafte, to the Top of the
Hill, I crofs'd toward the Sea ; and having a very
ttort Cut, and all down Hill, clap'd myfelf in
the way, between the Purfuers, and the purfu'd ;
hollowing aloud to him that fled, who looking
back, was at firft perhaps as much frighted at me
as at them ; but I beckonUwith my Hand to him,
to come back, and in the mean Time, I flowly ad-
vanced towards the two that foUow'd ; then rufhing
at once upon the foremoft, I knock'd him down with
the Stock of my Piece ; 1 was loth to fire, becaufe
I would not have the reft hear; though at that
Diftance it would not have been eafily heard,
and being out of Sight of the Smoak too, they
wou'd not have eafily known what to make of it :
Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who
purfuM him ftopt, as if he had been frighted;
and I advanced apace towards him ; but as I came
nearer, I perceived prefently, he had a Bow and
Arrow, and was fitting it to fhoot at me ; fo 1 was
then neceffitated to fhoot at him firft, which I did,
and killed him at the firft Shoot ; the poor Savage
who fled y but had ftop'd , though he faw both
his Enemies .fallen, ^nd kill'd, as he thought ; yet

was



[241]

>tni fo frighted with the Fire, and Noife of my
Piece, that he flood flock ftill 5 v and neither came
forward or went backward, tho' he feem'd rather
inclined to fly ftill, than to come on ; I hollpw'd
again to him, and made Signs to come forward,
which he eafily underftood, and came a little Way,
then ftop'd again ; and then a little farther, and
ftop'd again; and I could then perceive that he
flood trembling, as if he had been taken Prifoner,
and had juft been to be kill'd, as his two Enemies
were. I beckon'd him again to come to me, and
gave him all , the Signs of Encouragement that I
could think of, and he came nearer and nearer,
kneeling down every ten or twelve Steps, in Token
of Acknowledgment for my faving his Life : I fmifd
at him, and look'd pleafantly, and beckon'd to him
to come ftill nearer; at length he came clofe to me,
and then he kneel'd down again, kifs'd the Ground,
and laid his Head upon the Ground, and. taking
me by the Foot, fet my Foot upon his Head ;
this, it feems, was in Token of fwearing to be my
Slave for even I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could: But there
was more Work to do yet, for I perceiv'd the Sa-
vage, whom I knock'd 4<>wn, was not killed, but
ftun'd with the Blow, and-began to come to him-
felf ; fo I pointed to him, and Ihowing him the Sa-
vagej that he was not dead; upon this he fpoke
fome Words to me, and tho' I could not underftan3
them, yet I thought they were pleafant to hear,
for they were the firft Sound of a Man's Voice that
I had heard, my own excepted, for above twenty-five
Years. But there was no Time for fuch Reflec-
tions now; the' Savage, who was knocked down,
tecover'd himfelf fo far, as to fit up upon the
Ground, and I perceived that my Savage began to
be afraid ; but when I faw that, I prefented my

r' - *

other Piece at the Man, as if I would (hoot hirff ;
upon this my Savage, forfol call him now, made a
Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung
naked in a Belt by my Side,- fo I did : He no (bon-
er had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at one
Blow cut off his Head as cleverly, no Executioner
in Germany could have done it fooner or better;
which I thought very ftrange, for one, who I had
reafon to believe, never faw a Sword in his Life be*
fore, except their own wooden Swords ; however,
it feems, as I learned afterwards, they make their
wooden Swords fo (harp, fo heavy, and the Wood
is fo hard, that they will cut off Heads even with
them, aye and Arms, and that at one Blow too :
When he had done this, he comes laughing to me
in Sign of Triumph, and brought me the Sword
again, and with abundance of Geftures, which I
did not underftand, laid it down with the Head of
the Savage, that he had kill'd juft before me.

But that which aftonifh'd him moft, was to know
how I had kilTd the other Indian fo far off ; fo,
pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let him go
to him ; fo I bad him go, as well as I could ; when
he came to him, he flood like one amaz'd, looking
at him, turn'd him firft on one Side, then on t'other,
look'd at the Wound the Bullet had made, which
it feems was juft in his Breaft, where it had made a
Hole, and no great Quantity of Blood had followed,
but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead :
He took up his Bow and Arrows, and came back,
fo I turn'd to go away, and beckoned to him to fol-
low me, making Signs to him, that more might come
after them.

Upon this he fign'd to me, that he fhould bury
them with Sand, that they might not be feen by the
reft if they follow'd ; and fo I made Signs again to
him to do fo $ he fell to work, and in an Inftant he

had



C H3 1

had fcrap'd & Hole in the Sand with his Hands, big
enough to bury the firft in, and then drag'd him in-
to it, and cover'd him, and did fo alio by the other c
I believe he had bury'd them both in a Quarter of
an Hour ,- then calling him away, I carry 'd him, not
to my Caftle, but quite away to my Cave, on the
farther Part of the Iiland ; fo I did not let my Dream
come to pafs in that Part, viz. That he came into
my Grove for Shelter.

Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raifins to
eat, and a Draught of Water, which I found he
was indeed in great Diftrefs for, by his Running ;
and having refreftiM him, I made Signs for him to
go lie down and deep, pointing to a I? lace where I
had laud a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and a Blanket
upon it, which I ufed to fleep upon myfelf fonje-
times i fo the poor Creature laid down and went, to
deep:

He was a comely handfome Fellow, perfc&ly well
made, with ftrait long Limbs, not too large, tall
and well fhap'd ; and, as I reckon, about twenty-fix
Tears of Age. He had a very good Countenance*
rtot a fierce and furly Afped, but feem'd to have
fomething very Manly in his* Face, and yet he had
all the Sweetnefs and Softnefs of an European in his
Countenance too, efpecially when he fmil'd. His
Hair was long and black, not curl'd like Wool; his
Forehead very high, and large, and a great- Vivacity
and fparkling Sharpnefs in his Eyes. The Colour of
his Skin was not quite black, but very tawny, and
yet not of an ugly yellow naufeous Tawny, as the
Bmfilimsy and Virginians, and other Natives of
America are, but of a bright kind of a dun Olive
Colour, that had in it fomething very agreeable,
tho* not very eafy to defcribe. His Face was round
and [dump, his Nofe fmall, not flat like the Ne*
groev a very good Mouth, thin Lips, and his

R 2 fine



[ M4 3

fine Teeth well fet, and white as IvOry. After he
had flumber'd, rather than flept, about half an
Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of the Cave
to mCy for I hadbeen milking my Goats, which I
had in the Enclofure juft by : When he efpy'd me,
he cam& running to me, laying himfelf down
again upon the Ground, with all the poffible Signs
of an humble thankful Difpofition, making a many
antic k Geftures to (how it : At laft he lays his
Head flat upon the Ground, clofe to my Foot, and
fets my other Foot upon his Head, as he had done
ketone ;. and after this, made all the Signs to me of
Subje&ion, Servitude, and Submiffion imaginable,
to let me know how he would ferye me as long as
he liv'd. 1 underftood.him in many Things, and
let him know I was very well pleas'd with him ; in
a. little Time I began to fpeak to him,, and teach
him to fpeak to me ,- and firft, I made him know
his. Name fbould be Friday* which was the Day I
fav'd his.Life ,• I call'd turn fo for the Memory of
the Time ; I likewife taught him to lay Mafter, and
then let him know that was to be my Name i I
Jikewife taught him to fay Tes and No y and to know
ithe Meaning of then* ; I gave him forue Milk in an
earthen Pot, and let him fee me drink it before
tiim, arid fop my Bread in it; and I gave him a
Cake of Bread to do the like, which he quickly
comply'd. with, and made Signs that it was very
good for him.

I kept there with bira all that Night, but as foon
as it was Day, I beckon 'd. to him to come with
me, and let him know I would give him fome
Cloaths, at which he feem'd very glad, for he was
flark-naked : As we went by the Place where he
had bury'd the two Men, he pQinted exaftly to the
Place, and fhew'd „• me the Marks that he had
made to find them again, making Signs to me

that



C 245 ] •

that we fbould dig*them up again,, and eat them;-
.^t this I appeared very ahgry, «xpre£s 'd my Ab-
horrence of itj made as if I would vomit at the ;
Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to
him to come away, which he did immediately*
with great Subihiffion. I then led him up. to the
Top of the Hill, to fee if his Enemies were gone ; .
and pulling out my Glaft, I looked, and faw plain-.
ly the Place wherfc they had. been, but rio Appea-
rance of thejn, or of their Can&es; fo that it was
plain that they were gone, and had left their two
Comrades behind them, without any Search after
them.

But I was not content with this Difcovery, but ■■
having now more Courage, and confequently more
Curiofity, I took my Man Friday with me, giving,
him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and
Arrows at his Back, which I found he could ufe
very dexteroufly, . making him carry one Gun for me,
and I two for myfelf, and away we marched to the
Place where thefe Creatures had been ; for I had a
Mind now to get fome fuller Intelligence of them :
When I came to the Place, my very Blood ran
chill in my Veins, and my Heart funk, within me
at the Horror of the Spe&acle : Indeed it was a
dreadful Sight, at leaft it was fo to me, tho ? Friday
made nothing of it : The Place was cov^r'd with
humane Bones, the Ground dy'd with their Blood,
great Pieces of Flefli left here and there, half
eaten, mangled and fcorch'd ; and, in fhort, all the
Tokens of the triumphant Feaft they had been
making there, after a Viftory over their Enemies.
I faw three Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of -
three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance of other
Parts of the Bodies ; and Friday, by his Signs, made
me underftand, that they brought over four Pri{bners
to feaft upon ; that three of them were eaten up,

R 3 and



and that he, pointing to himfelf, was the fourth i
That there had been a great Battle between them,
and their next King, whofe Subje&s it feems he had
been one of; and thfit they had taken a great Num-
ber of Prifoners, all which were carry'd to feveral
Places by thofe that had takfen them in the Fight,
in order to feaft upon them, as was done here by
thefe Wretches upon thofe they brought hither.

I caus'd Friday to gather all the Skulls, Bones,
Flefh, and whatever remained, and lay them tor
gether on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it,
and burn them all to Afhes : I found Friday had ftill
a hankering Stomach after fome of the Flefh, and
was £1111 a Cannibal in his Nature ; but I difcovefcl
fo much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of it, anc|
?it the leaii Appearance of it, that he djirft not di£
(cover it ; for I had, by ferae Means, let him know,
that I would kill him if he offered it.

When we had done this we came back to our
Gaftle, and there I fell to work for my Man Frifay^
and firft of all I gave him a Pair of Linen Drawers,
which I had out of the poor Gunner's Chcft I men-
tioned, and which I found in the Wreck ; and which,
with a little Alteration, fitted him very well ; then
I made him a Jerkin of GoatVskin, as well as my
gkill would allow ; and I was now grown a tolerable
good Taylor ; and I gave hjm a Cap, which I h^d
made of- a Hare-skin, very convenient and faihion-
able enough ; and thus - he was cloath'd, for the
prefent, tolerably well, and was mighty well pleas'4
to fee himfelf almoft as well cloath'd as his Matter :
It is true, he went aukwardly in thefe Things at firft ;
wearing the Drawers was very aukward to hijn,
and the Sleeves of the Waftcoat gall'd his Shoulders,
jand the infide of his Arms; but a little eafing
them, where he complained they hurt him, and






*%r-



C H7 3

irfing himfelf to them, at length he took to them
very well.

The next Day after I came Home to my Hutch
with him, I began to confider where I fhould lodge
him ; and that I might do well for him, and yet be
perfe&ly eafy myfel£ I made a little Tent for him
in the vacant Place between my two Fortifications,
in the Infide of the laft, and in the Outfide of the
firft : And as there was a Door or Entrance there,
into my Cave, I made a formal fram'd Door-cafe,
and a Door to it of Boards, and fet it up in the
Paffage, a little within the Entrance ; and caufing
the Door to open on the Infide, I bar'd it up in the
Nigh?, taking in my Ladders too ; fo that Friday
could no way come at me in the Infide of my inner-
most Wall, without making fo much Noife in getting
over, that it muft needs waken me; for my firit
Wall had now a cbmpleat Roof over it of long
Poles, covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the
Side of the Hill, which was again laid crofs with
fmaller Sticks inftead of Laths, and then thatch'4
over a great Thicknefs with the Rice Straw, which
was ftrong like Reeds ; and at the Hole or Place
which was left to go in or out by the Ladder, I had
plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which, if it had been
attempted on the Out-fide, would not have open'J
at all, but would have fallen down, and made a
great Noife ; and as to Weapons, I took them all
in to my Side every Night,

But I needed none of all this Precaution ; for
never Man had a more faithful, loving, fincere Ser-
vant than Friday was to me; without Paflions,
Sullennefs, or Defigns, perfe&ly oblig'd and en-
gaged: his very Affe&ions were ty'd to me, like
thofe of a Child to a Father ; and I dare fay, he
would have facrificed his Lite for the faving mine,
upon any Occafion whatfoever ; the many Teftimo-

R 4 nies



nics he gave me of this, put it out cf Doubt, and
foon convinced me, that" I needed to ufe no Precau-*
tions as to my Safety on his Account,

This frequently gave me Occafion to obferve,*
and that with Wonder, that however it had pleas'd
God in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from fo great a
Part of the World of his Creatures, the beft Vfes
to which their Faculties and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted $ yet that he has beftow'd upon,
them the fame Powers, the fame Reafon, the fame
Affe&ions, the fame Sentiments of Kindnefs and
Obligation, the fame Paffions and Refentments of
Wrongs, the fame Senfe of Gratitude, Sincerity,
Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good,
3nd receiving Good, that he has given to us ; and
that when he pleafes to offer to them Occafions of
exerting thefc, they are as ready, nay, more ready
to apply them to the right Ufes for which they
were beftow'd, than we are. And this made mc
yery melancholy fometimes, in reflecting, as the fe-?
veral Occafions prefented, how mean a Ufe we
make of all thefe, even though we have thefc
Powers enlightened by the great Lamp of Inftruc*
tion, the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of
his Word, added to our Underftanding ; and why
it has pleased Gdd to hide the like faving Know-'
ledge from fo many Millions of Souls, who (if I
might judge by this poor Savage) would make a
much better Ufe of it than we did.

From hence I fometimes was led too far to in*
vadc the Sovereignty of Providence ; and, as it were,
arraign the Juftice of fo arbitrary a Difpofition of
Things,' that fhould hide that Light from fome ?
^nd reveal it to others, and yet exped a like Duty
from both : But I fliut it up and checked my
^Thoughts with this Conclusion, Jftft, Th v we did



[ M9 3

not know by what Light and Law thefe fhould be
condemned ; but that, as God was neceffarily, and,
by the Nature of his Being, infinitely holy and juft,
fo it could not be, but that if thefe Creatures were
all fentene'd to Abfence from himfelf, it was on Ac-
count of finning againft that Light, which, as the
Scripture fays, was a Law to themfelves, and by
fuch Rules as their Confidences would acknowledge
to be juft, tho' the Foundation was not difcover'd
to us : And, Secondly, That ftill as we are all the
Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no Veflel could fay
to him, Why haft thou form'd me thus ?

But to return to my new Companion : I was
greatly delighted with him, and made it my Bufi-
nefs to teach him every Thing that was proper to
make him ufeful, handy and helpful ; but efpecially
to make him fpeak, and underftand me when I
fpake ,• and he was the apteft Scholar that ever was,
and particularly was fo merry, (p conftantly diligent,
and fo pleas'd when he could but underftand me, or
make me underftand him, that it was very pleafant
to me to talk to him ,• and now njy Life began to
be fo eafy, that I began to fay. to myfelf, that
could I but haye.been fafe from more Savages, I
cared not if I was never to remove from the Place
while I liv'd.

After I had been two or three Days return'd to
my Caftle, I thought, that, in order to bring Friday
off from his horrid Way of feeding, and from the
Relifli of a Canibal's Stomach, I ought to let him
tafte other Flefli ; fo I took him out with me one
Morning to the Woods. I went indeed, intending
to kill a Kid out of my ; own Flock, and bring it
home apd drefs it: But as I was going, I faw
a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two
young Kids fitting by her. I catch'd hold of Friday,

fiolflj fay? I, ftan4 ftill i and made Signs tp hix?i

[ ijo ]

net to ftir, immediately I prefentcd my Piece* (hot
and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature,
who had at a Diflance, indeed, feen me kill the
Savage, his Enemy, but did not know, or could
imagine, how it was done, was fenfibly furpriz'd,
trembled and (hook, and look'd fo amaz'd, that I
thought he would have funk down. He did not fee
the Kid I had fhot at, or perceive I had kill'd it,
but rip'd up his Waftecoat to feel if he was not
wounded ,• and, as I found, prefeptly thought I was
refolv'd to kill him ; for he came and kneel'd down
to me, and embracing my Knees, faid a great
many Things I did not underfland, but I could
eafily fee that the Meaning was to pray me not to
kill him.

I foon found a Way to convince him that I would
do him no Harm, and taking him up by the Hand,
laugh 'd at him, and pointing to the Kid which I
had kill'd, beckon'd to him to run and fetch it,
which he did; and while he was wondering and
looking to fee how the Creature was kill'd, I loaded
my Gun again, and by-and-by 1 faw a great Fowl
like a Hawk fit upon a Tree within (hot ; fo, to
let Friday underfland a little what 1 would do, I
call'd him to me again, pointing at the Fowl, which
was indeed a Parrot, tho' I thought it had been a
Hawk ; I fay, pointing to the Parrot, and to my
Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let
him fee I would make it fall, I made him under-
fland that I would (hoot and kill that Bird ; accor-
dingly I fir'd, and bad him look, and immediately
he faw the Parrot fall ; he flood like one frighted
again, notwithftanding all I had faid to him ; and I
found he was the more amaz'd, becaufe he did not
fee me put any thing into the Gun ; but thought
that there muft be fome wonderful Fund of Death
and Deftru&ion in that Thing, ablq to kill Man,

Bcaft,



C 151 ]

Beaft, Bird, or any thing near or far off ; and the
Aftonifliment this created in him was fuch, a?
could not wear off for a long Time ; and I believe,
if I would have let him, he would have worfliip'd
me and my Gun : As for the Gun itfelf, he would
not fo much as touch it for feveral Days after ; but
would fpeak to it, and talk to it, as if it had an-
fwer'd him, when he was by himfelf ,• which, as I
afterwards learn'd of him, was to defire it not to
kill him.

Well : After his Aftonifliment was a little over
at this, I pointed to him to run and fetch the Bird
I had fhot, which he did, but ftay'd fome Time ;
for the. Parrot not being quite dead, was fluttered
a good way off from the Place where fhe fell ,• how-
ever, he found her, took her up, and brought her to
me ; and, as I had perceiv'd his Ignorance about the
Gun before, I took this Advantage to charge the
Gun again, and not let him fee me do it, that I
might be ready for any other Mark that might pre-
fent ; but nothing more offered at that Time ; fo I
brought home the Kid, and the fame Evening I took
the Skin pff, and cut it out as well as I could ; and
having a Pot for that Purpofe, I boiJPd or ftew'd
fome of the Flefh, and made fome very good Broth ; .
and after I had begun to eat fome, I gave fome to
my Man, who feem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it
very well ; but that which was ftrangeft to him, was
to lee me eat Salt with it ; he made a Sign to me,
that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a
little, into his own Mouth, he feem'd to naufeate it,
and would fpit and fputter at it, wafhiflg his Mouth
with frelh Water after it ; on the other Hand, I took
fome Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pre-
tended to fpit and fputter for want of Salt, as faft as
Ji? had done at the Salt ; but it would not do, he

would



C *5* ]"

would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his
Broth ; at leaft, not a great while, and then but a
very little.

Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth,
I was relolv'd to feaft him the next Day with roaf-
tinc a Piece of the Kid ; this I did by hanging it
before the Fire in a String, as I had fecn many People
do in England, fetting two Poles up, one on each
Side the Fire, and one crofs on the top, and tying
the String to the crofs Stick, letting the Meat tutti
continually : This Friday admir'd very much ; but
when he came to tafte the FTtefli, he took To many
ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that I could
not but understand him ; and at laft he told me he
would never eat Mans Flefh any more, which I
was very glad to hear.

The next Day I fet him to work to beating fome
Corn out, and lifting it in the Manner I ufed to do,
as I obferv'd before ,• and he foon underftood how to
do it as well as I, efpecially, after he had feen what
the meaning of it was, and that it was to make
Bread of; for after that I let him fee me make my
Bread, and bake it too ; and in a little Time Friday
was able to do all the Work for me, as well as I
could do it rayfelf.

I began now to confider, that haying two Mouthsl
to feed inftead of one, I muft provide more Ground
for my Harveft, and plant a larger Quantity of
Corn than I ufed to do ,• fo I marked out a larger
Piece of Land, and began the Fence in the fame
Manner as before, in which Friday not only work'd
very willingly and very hard, but did it very
chearfully ; and I told him what it was for, that it
was for Corn to make more Bread, becaufe he was
now with me, and that I might have enough for
him and myfelf too : He appeared very fenfible of
that Part, and let me know, that he thought I had

much



[ uj ] .

much more Labour upon me on bis Account, than
I had for myfelf ; and that he would work the
harder for me, if I would tell him what to do.

This was the pleafanteft Year of all the Life 1
led in this Place : Friday began to talk pretty well,
and underftand the Names of almoft every thing I
had CJccafion to call for, and of every Place I had
to fend him to, and talk a great deal to me ; fq
that, in fliort, I began now to have fome ufe for my
Tongue again, which indeed I had very little Oc-
cafion for before ; that is to fay, about Speech: Be-
sides the Pleafureof talking to him, I had a Angu-
lar Satisfaction in the Fellow himfelf ,- his fimple
unfeign'd Honefiy appear 'd to me more and more
every Day, and I began really to love the Creature;
and on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it
was poffible for him ever to love any Thing before 1 .

I. had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering
Inclination to his own Country again ; and having
learn M him En&lijb fo well, that he could anfwer
me almoft any Queftions, I ask'd him whether the
'Nation that he belonged to never conquered in
Battle ? At which he fmil'd, and (aid, Yes, .yes, we
always fight the better; that i% he meant always
get the better in Fight ; and fo we began the fol-
lowing Difcourfe. Yon always fight the better, fa id
I, How came you to be taken Prifoner then, Friday}

Friday. My Nation beat much, for all that.

Mafier. How beat ; if your Nation beat them,
how came you to be taken ?

Friday. They more many than my Nation in the
Place where me was ; they take one, two, three,
and .me ; my Nation over-beat them in the yonder
JPlacp, where me no was ; there my Nation take
.one/ two, great Thoufand.
; . Mafier. But why did not your Side recover you
from the Hands of your Enemies then ?

Friday.

JFWdty. They run one, two, tltfee, and me^ and
make go in the Canoe ; my Nation have no Canoe
that Time.

Mafter. WtyJ, Friday, and what does your Na-
tion do with the Men they take, do they carry
them away, and eat them, as thefe did ?

Friday. Yes, my Nation eat Man's too, eat all

up.

Mafter. Where do they carry them ?

Friday. Go to other Place where they think.

Mafter. Do they come hither ?

Friday. Yes, yes, they come hither ; come ©the*
elfe Place.

Mafter. Have you been here with them ?

Friday. Yes, I been here ; [prim to the N. W. Side
of the Iflandy yohkh, ttfeems, was their Side."]

By this I underftood, that my Man Friday halt
formerly been among the Savages, who afed to
come on Shore on the farther Part of the Ifland, oa
the faid Man-eating Occasions that he was now
brought for ; and ibme Time after, when I took &t
Courage to carry him to that Side, feeing the fame
I formerly mention'd, he prefently knetv the Pla<#>
and told me, he was there once when they eat up
twenty Men, two Women, and one Child : Hfc
could not tell twenty in Englijb ; but he numbttM
them by laying fo many Stones in sl Row, and
pointing to me to tell them over.

I have told this Paflage, becaufe it introduces
what follows ,• that after I had had this Difcotirfe
with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our
Bland to the Shore, and whether the Canoes werfc
not often loft,- he told me there was no Danger
no Canoes ever loft ; but that after a little Way 6*
to the Sea, there was a Current, and a Wind- afr
ways one Way in the Morning, the other in -the
Afternoon*



This I undetftood to be no more than the Sets of
the Tide, as going out, or coming in; but I after-
wards underftood, it was occafion'd by the great
J>aft and Reflux of the mighty River Oroonooko ; in
the Mouth or the 'Gulph of which River, as I
thought afterwards, our Ifland lay ; and that this
Land, which I perceiv'd to the IV. and N. W. was
the great Ifland Trinidad, on the North Point of the
Mouth of the River. I ask'd Friday a thoufan4
Queftions about the Country, the Inhabitants, the
Sea, the Coaft, and what Nations were near ; he
told me all he knew, with the greateft Opennefe
imaginable. I ask'd him the Names of the feveral
Nations of his fort of People, but could get np
other Name than Car its; from whence I eaftly uflr
derftood, that thefe were the Caribbees, which our
Maps place on the Part of America, which reaches
from the Mouth of the River Oroonooko to Guiana,
and onwards to St. Martha : He told me that up a
great Way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond,
the fetting of the Moon, which muft be W. from
their Country, there dwelt white bearded Men,
like me ; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which
I mentioned before * and that they had kill'd much
Mam, that was his Word : By all which I under-
flood, he meant the Spaniards, whofc Cruelties in
America had been fpread over the whole Countries,
and were remembered by all the Nations from Father
to Son.

I enquired if he could tell me how I might coffle
from this Ifland, and get among thofe white Mea;
he told me, Tes, yes, I might go in two Canoe ; 1
could not understand what he meant, or make him
defcribe to me what he meant by two Canoe, till at
laft, with great Difficulty, I found he meant it muft
be in a large great BoaCas big as two Canoes. . .

f fifr



This Part ot Friday's Difcourfe began to rdifli
with me very well, and from this Time I entertained
fome Hopes, that one Time or other, I might find
an Opportunity to make my Efcape from this Place ;
and that this poor Savage might be a Means to
help me to do "it.

Daring the long Time that Friday has now beeft
with me, and that he began to fpeak to me, and
underftand me, 1 was not wanting to lay a Founda-
tion of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particu-
larly, I asKd him one Time, Who made him?
The poor Creature did not underftand me at all,
but thought I had ask'd who was his Father : But
I took it by another Handle, and ask'd him who
made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the
Hills and Woods? he told me it was one old Be-
namuckte, that liv'd beyond all : He could defcribe
nothing of this great Perfon, but that he was very
old ; much older,- he fa id, than the Sea or the Land,
than the Moon or the Stars : I ask'd him then, if
-this old Perfon had made all Things, why did not
all Things worfliip him ? He look'd very grave, and
with a perfeft Look of Innocence, (aid, AU Things
faid to him : • I ask'd him if the People, who die
iii his Country, went away any where ? He faid,
Yes, they all went to Benamuckee: Then I ask'd
'him, Whether thefe they eat up went thither too ?
-He faid, Yes.

From thefe Things I began to inftrud him in
the Knowledge of the true God. I told him, That
the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,
pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs
the World by the fame Power and Providence by
which he had made it : That he was Omnipotent,
could do every Thing for us, give every Thing to
us, take every Thing from us ,• and ^thus, by de-
grees, I open'd his Eyes. He liften'd with great At-
tention*



t&htiotii and received with Pleafure tlie Notion of
jfefas Chrift, being feht to redeem us, and. of the(
Manner of making our Prayers to God, and bis
being able to beat us, evea into Heaven. He told
hve one Day, that if our 'Ood could* hear, us up. be*
yond the Sun, he rauft needs be a greater God than
their Benamuckee, who liv'c£ but 3t little . Way off,
and yet could not hear, 'tiftt the^r went op to the
great Mountains where he dweltp«to fpeaktb him :
I ask'd him if ever he went thither to ipeak to
hid. He faid, No, they never went thati Deere
young Men; none went thirher but the old iMen*
Who he cafl'd their Ooivokakee> thz$ is, as tjinade
him explain it; to m£, their Religious, or Clergy,
and that they went to fay 0, (fa he calTdi&ying
Prayers) and then came back, and told them what
Benomuckee faid. "By this J bbferv'd, That there is
Prieflcrafty even amongft the moft blinded ignoranc
Pagans in the World ; and the .Policy of making a
fecret Religion; in order to preferve the Veneratioo
of the People to the Clergy, is not only to be found
in the Roman, but perhaps athong all Religions in
the World, even among the moft brutifh and barba-
rous Savages. ■..*.. ■ v-" :

I endeavour d to dear up this Fraud to my.
Man Friday, and told him, That the Pretence o£
their old Men going up to the Mountains to fay.0
to their God Benomuckee, was a Cheat, and their
bringing Word from theflce • what he faid, was
much more -fo j that if they met with any AniWer*
or fpoke with any* one there, itmuft be with 4a
evil Spirit : And then I entered into a long Di£
courfe with hirti about the^ Devil, the Original of
him, his • Rebellion againft God, his Enmity td
Man, "the Reatbn of it, his fetting himfelf upift
the dark : Parts of the World to be worihip'd in*
fiead of God, and as God; and the mady Strata;
-•■- S gems



[ U8 ]

gems he made ufc of, to delude Mankind to their
Ruin ; how he had a fecret Accefs to. our Paffionsy
and to our Aflfe&ions, to adapt his Snares fo to our
Inclinations, as to caufe us even to be our own
Tempters, and to run upon our Deftru&iou by our
own Choice.

I found it wit not lb eafy to imprint right No-
tions in his Mind abott the Devil, as it was about
the Being of a God- Nature affifted all my Argu-
ments co evidence to him even the Neceffity of a
great firft Caufe and over-ruling governing Power,
a fecrfct dirc&ing Providence, and of the Equity
and Juftice of paying Homage to him that made
us, and the like. But there appeared nothing of all
this in the Notion of an evil Spirit, of his Ori-
ginal, his Being, his Nature, and above all, of his
Inclination to do Evil, and to draw us in to do
fi> too. And the poor Creature puzzled me once
in fuch a Manner, by a Queftion meerly natural
and innocent, that I fcarce knew what to fay to
him. I had been talking a great . deal to him of
the Power of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful
Aversion to Sin, his being a confuming Fire to th?
Workers of Iniquity ; how, as he had made us all,
he could deftroy us and ail the World in a Moment;
and he liften'd with great Serioofaffs to me all the
while.

After this, I had been telling him how the De-
vil was God's Enemy in the Hearts of Men, and
ufed all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
Defigns of Providence, and to ruin the Kingdom
of Chrift in the World, and the like. Well, lays
Friday, but you fay, God is fo firong, fo great, is
be not much ftrong, much might . as the Devil i
3fes^:;yes, fays I, Friday, God is flronger than the
Devil, God is above the Devil, ar>d therefore we
pray to v God to tread him down under our Feet*
■'"'•• - and

and enable us to refift his Temptation*, afid quench
his fiery Darts. But, fays lie again, if God muck
firong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the Dt*
vil, fo make him no more do wicked?

I was ftrangely furpriat'd at his Queftion, and
after all, tho' I was now an old Man, yet I was
but a young Do&or, and ill ehough qualify M foe
a Cafuift, or a Solver of Difficulties : And, at firft,
I could not tell what to fay, fo I pretended not to
hear him, and ask'd him what he faid? But he
was too earneft for an Anftfer to forget his Quef-
tion ; fo that he repeated it in the very fame broken
Words, as above. By this Time I had recovered
myfelf a little, and I faid, God will at loft punifh
him feverely ; he is referv'd fir the Judgment, and ii
to be caft into the Bottomlefs Pit, to dwell with ever*
lofting fhe. This did not fatisfy Friday, but he re-
turns upon xrte^ repeating my Words, Reserve
at last, me no wider/land, But, Why not kill the
Devil now, not kill great ago I You may as well ask
me, faid I, Why God docs not kill you and I„
when we do wicked Things here that offend him.
We arc prefeiVd to repent and be pardon'd : He
mufes a while at this; IVeB, well, fays he, mighty,
affeftionatdy, that well; fo y&u, I, Devil, all wick*
ed, all preferve, refem, God far don all. Here I was
run down again by him to the laft Dzgree* and it
was a Teftimony to me, how the meer Notions o£
Nature, though they will guide reafonable Crea-
tures to the Knowledge of a God, and of a Wor-*
ftiip or Homage due to the fupreme Being of God,
as the Confequcnce of our Nature; yet nothing but
divine Revelation can form the Knowledge of Je-
fftt Chrifl, and of a Redemption purchased for us, of a
Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Interceflbr,
at the Foot Stool of God's Throne ; I fay, nothing
but a Revelation from Heaven can form thefc ia

S 2 the



{z6o ]

the Soul; and that therefore the Gofpef of bur
Lord and Saviour Jefus Chrift, I mean, the Word
of God, and the Spirit of God, promised for the
Guide and San&ifier of his People, are the abfo-
lutely neceffary Inftru&ors of the Souls of Men,
in the faving Knowledge of God, and the Means of
Salvation.

I therefore diverted the prefent Difcourfe be-
tween me and my Man, rifing up haftily, as upon
fome fudden Occafion of going out ; then fending
him for fomething a good Way off, I ferioufly pray'd
to God, that he would enable me to inftruft faving-
ly this poor Savage, affifting by his Spirit the
Heart of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the
Light of the Knowledge of God in Cbrift> recon-
ciling him to himfelf, and would guide me to fpeafc
fo to him from the Word of God, as his Confer-
ence might be convinced, his Eyes opened, and his
Soul fov'd. When he came again to me, I enter'd
into a long Difcourfe with him upon the Subjed of
the Redemption of Man by the Saviour of the
World, and of the Do&rine of the Gdfpel preach'd
from Heaven, viz. of Repentance tdwards God,
and Faith in our bleffed Lord Jefus. I then ex-
plain 'd to him, as well as I could, why our Bleflcd
Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels,
but the Seed of Abraham, and how for that Rca-
fon the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemp-
tion; that he came only to the loft Sheep of the Houfe
oHfrael, and the like.

I had, God knows, more Sincerity than Know-
ledge, in all the Methods I took for this poor
Creature's Inftruftion, and muft 'acknowledge" what
I believe all that aft upon the fame Principle will
find, That in laying Things open to him, I really
inform'd and inftrufted myfelf in many Things, that
either I did not know,, or had not fully confider'd

before;



[ 161 ]

before;. but which occur'd naturally to my Mind,
upon my fearcbing into them, for the Information
of this poor Savage ; and I had more Aftcdion in
tny Enquiry after Things upon this.Occafion, than
ever I felt before j fo that whether this poor wild
Wretch was the better for me, or no, lhad great
Reafon to bej thankful that eycr he came to me :
My Grief fet: lighter upon me, my Habitation
grew comfortable to me beyond Meafure ; and
when I .refte&ed . that in this foJitary Life which I
had been jconfuvd to, I had not only been inov'd
myfelf to look up to Heaven, and to feek to the
Hand that had brought me there ; but was now
to be made an Instrument under Providence to lave
.the Life, and y for ought I know* the Soul of a poot
Savage, and hring him to the true Knowledge of
Religion* and '$( the Chriftian Do&rine , that he
might .know Chrift Jefus, tQ kv<w whom is Life eter-
nal, I fay, When 1 reflected ,upon all thefe Things,
a fecret Joy run through every Part of my Soul*
and 1 frequently rejoie'd that ever I was brought to
this Place, which I had fo often thought the mod
dreadful of all Aifti&ions that could poffibiy have*
befallen me. = . ,

In this thankful Frame I continued all the -Re-
mainder of my Tijne, .and the Converfation which'
employed the Hours between Friday and I, was
fuch, *s made the three Years which we liv'd there
together perfe&ly and compleatly happy, ifanyfucb
^Xhing as coptflpat Happinefs can be form d in afuhkir
nary State. The Savage was now a good Chriftian,
a much better than 1 ,* though I have Reafon to
hope, and blefs God for it, that we were equally
penitent, and comforted reftorM Penitents ; we
had here the Word of God to read, and no farther
off from his Spirit to inftruft, than if we had been .
in England.

S 3 I always



I always apply'd myfclf to reading the Scrip?
ture, to let him know, as well as I could, the
Meaning of what I read ; and he again, by his fe~
rious Enquiries and Queftions, made me, as J
/aid before, a much better Scholar in the Scripture
Knowledge, than I ftiould ever have been by my
own private meer Reading. Another Thing 1 caiiT
not refrain from obferving here alfo from Experi-
ence, in this retire Part of my Life, vto» How in*
finite and inexpreffible a Bleffing it is, that the
Knowledge of God, and of th$ Doftrine of Salva?
pon by Cbrift Jefm, is fo plainfljTlaid down in the
Word of God, fo eafy to be receiv'd and under:
flood, that as the bare Reading the Scripture made
me capable of undemanding enough of jny Duty,
to carry me direftly on to the great Work of
fincere Repentance for my Sins, and laving hold
ef a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a ftated Re-
formation in Pra&ice, and Obedience to all God'?
Commands, and this without any Teacher or Inftruc-
ter (I mean, humane) fo the fame plain Inftruftion
Sufficiently ferv'd to the Eriljghtning this Savage
Creature, and bringing him to be iuch a Chriftian^
as I have known few equal to him in my Life.
- As to al| the Difputes, Wranglings, Strife, and
Contention, which has happen'd in the World about
Religion, whether Nineties in Doftrines, pr Schemes
of Church Gpvernment, they were all perfeftly ufe*
left to us, as for pught I can yet fee, they have
been to all the jreft in the World : We had the furt
Guide to Heaven, viz,. The Word of God ; and wc
had, Vijfei be God, comfortable Views of the Spi-
fit of God, teaching and infirufting us by his Word,
leading m into aU Truth, and making us both fil-
ling and obedient to the Inftniftion of his Word ;

Knowledge of the difpured Points in Religion,
which have made fuch Confafions in the World,
would have been 'to us, if we could have Qbtain'd
it : But I muft go on with the Historical Part of
Things, and take every Part in its Order*

After Friday and I became more intimately ac-
quainted, and that he could understand almoft ay
I faid to him, and /peak flucndy, though in broken
£xgHJh> to me | I acquainted him with my own
Story, or at leaft fo much of it as related to my
looming into the Place; how I had liv'd there, and
how long. I let him into the Myftery, for fuch
it was to him, of Gunpowder and. Bullet, and
taught him how to {hoot: I gave him a Knife,
which he was wonderfully delighted with, arid I
made him a Belt, with a Frog hanging to it, fuch
as in KngUnd we wear Hangers in ; and in the Frog,
ijiftead of a Hanger, \ gave him a Hatchet, which
was not only as good a Weapon in fome Cafes, but
much more ufeful upon other Occafions.

I defcrib'd to him the Country of Europe, <and
particularly England, which I came from ; how wc
liv'd, how we worlhip'd God* how we behav'd to
one another; and how we traded in Ships to all
Parts of the World : I gave him an Account of the
Wreck which I had been on board o£ and (hew'd
him as near as I could the Place where (he lay ;
but fhe was all beaten in Pieces before, and gone.

I fhew-d him the Ruins pf our Boat, which we
Joft when we efcap'd, and which I could not ftir
with my whole Strength then, but was now fallen
almoft alt to Peices : Upon feeing this Boat, Friday
flood mufing a great while, and faid nothing; I
AskM him what it was he ftudy'd upon ; at laft, fays
he, me fee fitch Boat like come to Place at my Nation.

I did not underftand him a good while ; but at
laft, when I had examin'd farther into it, I under-

fteod by him, that a Boat, fuch as that had beep,
came on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd j
that i&> as he explain'd it, was (driven thither by
Strefs of Weather : I prefently imaging, that fom?
European Ship iriuft have been call away wppn their
Coaft, and the Boat might get loofe, and drive
aftiore, but was Co dull, that I never ogee thought
of Men making efcape from a Wreck thither* much
lefs whence they might come ; fo I pnly epcjuir'4
after a Defcriptioaof the Boat* >fc

Friday defcrib'd the Boat to me well enpugh ; b»?
brought me better to underftand him, when ho pri-
ded with fome Warmth, wefave the white Mans from
drown : Then I prefently ask'd him, if there was any
white Mans, as he calTd them, in the Boat : Yes>
lie-faid, the Boat full of white Mans : I ask'd him how
many ; -he told upon his Fingers feyenteen ; I ask'd
■him then what became of them; he' told me* tbej
finje y . they dwell at my Nation. .

This put new Thoughts into mjr Head ; for J
prefently imagined, that thefe might be the Men
belonging to the Ship that w^s caft away in Sight
$f my Ifland, as I now call it ; and who, after the
Ship was ftruck on the Rock, and they fa w her inr
evitably loft, had fav'd themfelves in their Boat, and
were landed upon that wild Shpre, among the Sa-
vages.

Uppn th|s, J enquired of him more critically
tvhat was become of them; he aflbr'd me they
liv'd ftill there; that they had beeq there «dx>uf
four Years ; that the Savages let them alone, and
gave them Visuals to live, I jtsk'd .him, how i$
came to pafs they did not kill them and e^t them ;
its ftid, No y they make Brother with them; that is>
as I underftood him, a Truce : And then he adr
rfed, They no M Mans but wlpn make the War fight :

Battel..
It was after this, fome eonfiderable Time, that

being on the Top of the Hill, at the Eaft fide
of the Ifland, from whence, as I have faid, I had
jn a clear Day difcover'd the Main or Continent
x>f Amenta ; Friday^ the Weather being very ferene*
Jooks yery eattieiUy towards the main Land,; and
in a kind of Surprize falls a jumping and dancing-,
and calls out to me, for I was at tome Diftante
from him : I ask'4 him what was the Matter i X>
Joy ! fays he, O Glad ! 7%tre fee my Country, tbert
rny Nation! ' ■' ' '

I pbferv'd an extraordinary. Senfe of Heafure aj*-
pear'd in his Face, and his Eyes fparkled, and his
Countenance difcover'd a ftrange Eagernefs, as if
be had a Mind to be in his own Country again ;
and this Qbfejrvation of mine put a great many
Thoughts into me, which made, me at firft not fo
eafy about my new Man Friday as I was before^
and I made no Dpubt, but that if FHday.covdd grit
back co his own Nation again, he would .not ontjr
/orget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to
me ; and would be forward enoiigh to give his
Countjrymep an Account of me, and come back per-
haps, with a hundred or two of them, and make a
peaft upon me, at which he might be as merry ais
he ufed tp bfc "with thpfe of his Enemies, when
they were taken in War.

But I M^rong'd the poor honeft Creature very
jnuch, for which I was very forry afterwards.
However, as my Jealpufy incrcas'd, and held me
fome Weeks, I was a little more circumfpeft, and
npt fo familiar and kind to him as before; in
which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the ho-
peft grateful Creature JhavingnoThought about it,
few wte* confined with the. beft Principles, both

*s a religious Chtiftian, and as -a grateful Friend,
as appear'd afterwards to my full Satisfa&ion.

While my Jealoufy of him lafted, you may be
(ore I was every Day pumping him to fee if he
would difcover any of the new Thoughts, which I
fufpe&ed were in .him; but I found every Thing
he faid was fo honeft, and fo innocent, that I
could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion ; and,
in fpite of afy my Uneafinefs,- he made me at laft
entirely his awn again ; nor did he in the leaft per-
oeivcthat I was uneafy, «nd (Hereford J could not
iiifpeft him of Deceit.

One Day walking up the fame Hill, but the
Weather being hzzf at Sea, fo that we could not
fed the Continent, I rall'd to him, and faid, Frt-
day* do not .ybit wifli yourfelf ■ in your^own Coun-
try* ..your owin;Nation ? Tes, he (aid, / be much
glad M hi at \my etun Nation. What- would you do
there, faid 1, would you turn wild again, eat Mens
ftefli again, and be a Savage as you were before ?
JHe look' d full of Concern, and fhaking his Head,
ftid, No, .no> Friday tell them to live good, tell them
to pray. God i tell them to e& Corn-frreaJ, Cattle-Ftefb,
Milk,. n$ eat Man again : Why then,* (aid I to him,
<fhey.witt kill you. /He look'd gra*e at, that, and
then faid, No, theyno kiBnte, they willing love team;
He meant hy this, they would be willing to learn,
He added, they learn cl much o£ the bearded Mans
that came in the Boat. Then I ask'4 hira if he
vould go back to them ? He fmil'd at that, and
told me he could not fwim fo far* I told him 1
would make a Canoe for him. He told me, he
-would go, if I would go with him. ■ I go ! fays I,
why, they will eat me if I come there: No, at,
lays he, me make they no eat you^me make they much
love you. He meant, he would tell them how I had
kill'd his Enemies, and fav'd his Life, and fo he

would



[1*7 T-

would make them love me ; then he told me, is
well as he could, how kind they were to feventeen
white Men, or bearded Men, as he call'd them, ••
who came on Shore there in Diftrefs.

From this Time, I confefs, I had a Mind to -
venture over, and fee if I could poffibly join with-
jthefc bearded Men, who, I made no doubt, were
Spaniards or Portugmfe ; not doubting but, if I could,
we might find fome Method to efcapc from e
thence, being upon the Continent, and a good
Company together, better than I could frorii an
Ifland 40 Miles off the Shore, and alone without
Help. So, after (amc t)ays, I took Friday to work
again, by way of Difcourfe, and told him I would •
give him a Boat to go back to his own Nation ;
and accordingly I v carry'd him to my Frigatfc,
which lay on the other fide of the Ifland, and ha-
ving cleared it of Water, for I always kept it funk ■
jn the Water, I brought it out, fhew'd it him, and
we both went into it.

I found he was a mod dextrous Fellow at ma-
naging it, would make it go almoft as fwift and
faft again as I could ; fo when he was in, I faid t6 «
him, Well, now, Friday, lhail we go to your Na- *
tion ? He looked very dull at my faying 10, which,
it feems, was becaufe he thought the Boat too
fmall to go fo far. I told him then I had a bigger ;
fo the next Pay I went to the Place where the
firft Boat lay which I had made, but which I could
npt get into Water j He faid that was big enough ;
but then, as I had taken no Care of it, and it had
lain two or three and twenty Years there, the Sun
had *pMt * n <l dry'd it, that it was in a Manner
rotten. Friday told me, fuch a Boat would do ve-
ry well, and would carry much enough Fittfc, Drink,
Brtfid } that was his Way of Talking,

Upon



Upon the wholc # I was by this Time fo fix'd
upon my Defign of going over with hjm to the
Continent, that I told him we would go and make
one as big as that, and he. fhould go home in it.
He amfwer'd not one Word, but look'd very grave
and fed : I ask'd him what was the Matter with
him ; he ask'd me again thus, tVby you angry mad
with Friday, uhat rm dam ? I ask'd him what he
meant ; I told him I was not angry with him at all.
No angry ! No angry ! fays he, repeating the Words
feveral times, Why, fend Friday home away to my
Nation ? Why, fays J, Friday > did you not fay you
wifli'd you were 'therfc ? Yes, yes, fays he, wi/b be both
there, m wijb Friday there, no Mafter there. In a
word, he would not think of going there without
me; I go there, Friday, fays .1, what (hall I do
there ? He turn'd very quick upon me at this: Tou
do great deal much &wd, fays he, you teach wild M*w
be good fiber tpnte Mans ; you tell them know God,
pay God, and live new Ufe. Alas, Friday, fays J,
thou knoweft not what thou fayjft, I am but an
igporant Man my felf. Tes, yes, fays he, you teacbee
m Good, you teachee them Gocd. . No* np, Friday,
fays I, you (hall go without me, leave me here to
live by my fel£ as J did before. He look'd confos'd
again at that Word, and running to one of the
Hatchets which he us'd to wear, he takes it up
haftily, and gives it mc; what moft I do with this?
fays I to him ; Tou take kill Friday, fays he : What
muft I kill you for ? /aid I again. He returns ver
ry quick, What you fend Friday away for ? take kill
Friday, no fend Friday away. This he fpoke io
earneftly, that I faw Tears ftand in his Eyes- In
a word, I fo plainly difcover'd the utmoft Aflfedjtion
in him tp me, and a firm Refolution in him, that
I told him then, and often after, that I would ne-
ver fend him away from me, if he was willing to
ftjty w/th me. Upoq



C *<*9 ]

Upon the wholes as I found by all his Difcourfc
a fettled Affe&ion to me, and that nothing fhould
part him from me, fo I found all the Foundation
of his Defire to go to his own Country, was laid
in his ardent Affe&ion to the People, and his Hopes
of my doing them good ,• a Thing,- which as I had
no Notion of my felf, fo I had not the leaft Thought
or Intention, or Defire of undertaking it. But ftiil
I found a ftrong Inclination to my attempting an
Efcape, as above* founded on the Suppofition ga-
thered from the Difcourfe, (w*.) . That there .wem
feventeen bearded Men there, and therefore, with-
out any more Delay, I went to - " work with Friday
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a
large Periagua or Canoe to undertake the Voyage-
There were Trees enough in* the Ifland to have
built a little Fleet, hot of Pefiagua's and Canoes*
but even of good large Veflels. But the main Thing
I look'd at, was to get one fo near the Water that
we might launch it when it was made, to avoid
the Miftake 1 committed at firft.

At laft, Friday pitched upon a Tree, for I found he
knew much better than I what Kind of Wood was
fitteft for it ; nor can I tell, to this Day, whatWood
to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was
very like the Tree we call Fuftic, or between that
and the Nicaragua Wood, for it was much of the
fame Colour and Smell. Friday was for burning the
Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it foe
a Boat : But I {hew'd him how rather to cut ft out
with Tools, which after 1 had fhew'd him how
to ufe,.he did very handily, and in .about a Month's
hard Labour we finifh'd it, . J&iKl.made it very?
handfomc, efpecially when wititt our Axes, which I
fiiew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the
Out-fide mm the true Shape of a.Boat ; after this;
however, it coft us near a Fortnight's Time to get

■ . her



[i-70]

her along, as it were, Inch by Inch upon gtfeat
Rowlcrs into the Water. But when {he was in, {he 1
would have carry 'd twenty Men with great
Eafe.

. When fiie was in the Water* and tbo' fhe was fo
big, it amaz'd me to fee with what Dexterity and
how fwift my Man Friday would manage her, tuto
her, and paddle her along ; & I ask'd him if ho
would, and if we might venture over in her ; Tes, he
faid, be vtnttir wer in her very well, though great bkia
Wind. However* I had a farther Defign that he
knew nothing of,, and that was to make a Mail and
Sail, and to fit-her with ad Anchor and Cable : As
to a Maft, that was eafy enough to get ; fo I pitched
upon a ftrait young Cedar-Tree, which I found
near the Place, and which there was great Plenty
of. in the Ifland; and I fet Priday to Work to eut it
down, and gave him Diredions Ja>w to ihape and
order it. But as-to the Sail, that was my particular
Care ; I knew I had old Saite, or rather Piece* of
old Sails enough ; but as I had had them now
%6 Years by me, and had not been very careful
to prefer ve them, not imagining that I fhould evetf
have this kind of Ufe for them, I did not doubt
but they were all rotten ; and indeed moft of diem
were fo ; however, I found two Pieces which ap-
pear'd pretty good, and with thefe I went to woii,
and with a great deal of Pains, and aukward tedi-
ous Hitching (you may be fure) for Want of Needles*
I at length made a three-corncr'd ugly Thing, like
what we call in England, a Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, to go with a Boom at Bottom, and a little
ftiort Sprit at the Top, fuch as ufually our Ships
Long-Boats fail with, and fuch as I beft knew how
to manage ; becaufe it was fuch a one as I had to
the Boat in which I made my Efcape from Barbary,
as related in the firft Part of my Story.

I w»



[ *7* I

. f was near two .Months performing this laffi '.•
Work, m. rigging and fitting my Mail and Sails r
for I finifh'd them very complear, making a fmatt 1
Stay, and a Sail, or Forefeil to it, to affift, if we
fhould turn to Windward ; and which was more
than all, I fixd a. Rudder to the Stern of her, tt>
fteer with * and though I was but a bungling Ship-
wright, yet as I knew the U&fulnefs, and even
lSfeceffity of fucb a Thing, I apply'd myfelf with
fo much Pains to do it, that at laft I brought it to

Jafs, thp' confidering the many dull Contrivances
had for it that fail d, I think it coil me almoft as •
much Labour a& making the Boat.

After all this was done too, I had my Man Fri-
day to teach as to what belonged to the Navigation
of my Boat ; for though he knew very well How to
paddle a Canoe, . be knew nothing what belonged to
a Sail and a Rudder, and was the mod amaz/d
when he Jaw me work the Boat too and again in •
the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gybrd.and-
filled this Way or that Way, as the Courfe we failU
chang'd: I fay, when he faw this, he flood like
one aftoni(h'd and amaz'd : However, with a little
XJfe, I made all thefc Things familiar to him ; and
he became an expert Sailor, except that as to the
Compafs, I could make him underhand very little
of that. On the other Hand, as there was very little
cloudy Weather, and feldom -or never any Fogs in
tbofe Parts, there was the lefs Occasion for a Com-
pafs, feeing the Stars were always to be feen by
Night, and the Shore by Day, except in the mmy*
Seaforis, and then no Body cared to ft ir abroad, ci-
ther, by Land or Sea.

I was 'now entered on the feven and twentieth
Year of mv Captivity in this Place ,• though the
three laft Years that I had this Creature with me, ;
ought rather toi» left out of the Account, my Ha*

bitatioa



. [ *7* I

bit atioti being quite of another Kind than in all the
reft of the Time. I kept the Anniverfary of my
landing here with the fame Thankfulnefs to God
for his Mercies, as at firft ; and if I had fuch Caufe
of Acknowledgment at firft, I had much more fo
now, having fuch additional Teftimonies of the
Care of Providence over me, and the great Hopes
I had of being effe&ually and fpeedily deliver d ;
for I had an invincible Impreffion upon my Thoughts,
that my Deliverance was at Hand, and that I fhould
not be another Year in this Place : However, I wcbt
on with my Husbandry, digging, planting; fencing,
as ufual ; I gathered and cur'd my Grapes, and did
every neceffary Thing, as before.

The rainy Seafon was in the mean time upon
me, when I kept more within Doors than at other
Times ; fo I had ftow'd our new Vetfel as fecure as
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where,
as I faid, in the Beginning I landed my Rafts from
the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at high
Water Mark, I made my Man Friday dig a little
Dock, juft big enough to hold her, and juft deep
enough to give her Water enough to float in ; and
then, when the Tide was out, we made a ftrong
Dam crofs the End of it to keep the Water out ;
and fo (he lay dry, as to the Tide, from the Sea;
and to keep the Rain . off, we laid a. great many
Boughs of Trees fo thick, that fhe was as well
thatch'd as a Houie ; and thus we waited for the
Month of Nwember .and December ■, in which I de-
fign'd to make my Adventure.

When the fettled Seafon. began to come in, as
the Thought of my Dcfign returned with the fair
Weather, I was preparing daily for the Voyage ;
and th£ firft Thing . I did, was to lay by a certain'
Quantity of m Provisions, being the Stores for out
Voyage ; and intended, in a Wcek-or a Fortnight's
i.j. Time,



C*7J]

Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boat.
I was bufy one Morning upon fbmething of this
kind, when I calFd to Friday, and bid himgo to the
Sea Shore, and fee if he could find a Turtle, or
Tortoife, a Thing which we generally got once a
Week, for the Sake of the fcggs, as well as the
Fleih: Friday had not been long gone, when he
came running back, and flew over my outer Wall,
or Fence, like one that felt not the Ground, or the
Steps he fet his Feet on j and before I had Time to .
fpeak to him, he cries out to me, Mafier 1 Ma-
Jler! Sorrow! Obad! What's the Matter, Friday.
fays I * yonder , there, fays he, one, two, three Canoe !
one, two, three ! By his way of fpeaking I conclu-
ded there were fix •, but on Enquiry I found it Was
but three : Well, Friday, fays I, do not be frighted \
fo I heartened him up as well as I could : However*
I faw the poor Fellow was moft terribly fcar'd $ for
nothing ran in his Head but that they were come to
look for him, and would cut him in Pieces, and eat
him* and the poor Fellow trembled fb, that I
fcarce knew what to do with him : I comforted him
as well as I could, and told him I was in as much
Danger as be, and that they would eat me as well a s
him^ but, fays I, Fi 2 day, we tmtft refolve to fight them;
Can you fight, Friday ? Me Jboot, fays he, but there
come many great Number. No matter for that, faid
I again, our Guns will fright them that we dd not
kill* fo I aflc'd him, Whether if I refolv'd to defend
him, he would defend me, and ftand by me, and do
juft as I bid him ? He faid, Me die, when you bid die,
Mafier % fo I went and fetched a good Dram of
Rum, and gave him-, for I had been fo good a Hu£
band of my Rum, that I had a great deal left 1
When he had drank it, I made him take the two
Fowling;- Pieces, which we always carry 'd, and load
them with large S waft- Shot, as big as fmall Piftol

. T Bullets^



[»74]

Bullets*, then I took fourMufkets, and loaded them
with two Sings and five fmall Bullets each -, and
my two Piftols I loaded with a Brace of Bullets
each : I hung my great Sword as ufual, naked by
my Side, and gave Friday his Hatchet.

When 1 had thus prepar'd my felf, I took my Per-
fpedive Glafs, and went up to the Side of the Hill,
to fee what I could difcover \ and I found quickly*
by my Glafs, that there were one and twenty Sa-
vages, three Prifoners, and three Canoes * and that
their whole Bufinefs feem'd to be the triumphant
Banquet upon thefe three human Bodies, (a barba-
rous Fca ft indeed) but nothing more than as I had
obfervti. was ufual with them.

I obferv'd alfo, that they were landed not where
they had done when Friday made his Efcape, but
nearer to my Creek, where the Shore was low, and
where a thick Wood came clofe almoft down to the
Sea : This, with the Abhorrence of the inhumane
Frrand thefe Wretches came about, fill'd me with
fuch Indignation, that I came down again to Friday
and told him, I was refolv'd to go down to them,
and kill them all * and aflt'd him if he would ftand
bv me > He had now gotten over his Fright, and
his Spirits being a little rais'd with the Dram I had
"• given him, he was very chearful, and told me, as
before, be would die, when I bid die.

In fliis Fit of Fury, I took firft and divided the
Arms which I had charged, as before, between us:
I gave F) Wiiy one Piitol to ftick in his Girdle, and
three Guns upon his Shoulder-, and I took one Pi-
ftol, and the other three my felf -, and in thisPo-
fture we march\l out : I took a fmall Bottle of Rum
in my Pocket, and gave Friday a large Bag with
more Powder and Bullet ^ and as to Orders, I
charg'd him to keep clofe behind me, and not to
ftir, or lhoot, or do any thing, till I bid him* and

in



[ *7'5 ]

In the mean Time, not to {peak a Word : In this
Pofture I fetched a Compafs to my Right Hand of
near a Mile, as, well to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wood ^ fo that I might come within
Shot of them, before I (hould be difcoverd, which
I had feen by my Glafs ;t was ealy to do.

While I was making this March, myformey
Thoughts returning, I began to abate my Refolu-
tion 5 I do not inean, that I entertain'd any Feat
of their Number •, for as they were naked, lindrind
Wretches, 'tis certain I wlas fuperior to tfyem ^ nay*
though I had been alone-, but it occurred to my
Thoughts, What Call? What Occafion> ^mueh
lefs, What Neceifity I was in to go and dip my
Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had&ither
done or intended me any Wrong ? Who, as to hie,
were innocent, and whofe barbarous Cuftoms werd
their own Difafter, being in them a Token indeed
of God's having left them, with the other Nations
of that Part of the World, to fuch Stupidity and
to fuch inhumane Courfes •, but did not call me to
take upon me to be a Judge of their Anions, much
left an Executioner ot his Juftice^ that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Caufe into his
own Hands, and by National Vengeance punilh ••
them as a People for National Crimes •, but that,
in the meantime, it was none of myBufinefsr| that
it was true, Friday might juftify it, becaufe he was
a declared Enemy, and in a State of War with thole
very particular People, and it was lawful for him
to attack them * but I could not fay the fame with
refpedt to me. Thefe Things were (b warmly
prets'd upon my Thoughts all the Way as I went,
that I refolv'd I would only go and place myfelf
near them, that I might obftrve their barbarous
Feaft, and that I would a& then as God fhould
direct ; but that unlefs fomething offer'd that was

T 2 more



[ *7«]

more a Call to me than yet I knew of, I would not
meddle with them.

With this Refolution I enter'd the Wood, and
with all pollible Warynefc and Silence (Fridaj fol-
lowing clofe at my Heels) I xnarch'd till I came
to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which waa
next to them ; only that one Corner of the Wood
lay between me and them : Here I call'd foftly to
Friday, and (hewing him a great Tree, which was
juft at the Corner of the Wood, I bad him go to
the Tree, and bring me Word if he could fee there
plainly what they were doing * he did fo, and came
immediately back to me, and told me they might
be plainly view'd there * that they were all. about
their Fire, eating the Flefh of one of their Priso-
ners \ and that another lay bound upon the Sand,
a little from them, which he (aid they would kill
next, and which fir' d all the very Soul within me.:
He told me it was not one of their Nation, but one
of the bearded Men, who he had told me of, that
came to their Country in the Boat ; I. wa$ filTd
\vith Horror at the very naming the white-bearded
Man, and, going to the Tree, I faw plainly, by my
Glafs, a white Man, who lay upon the Beach of
the Sea, with his Hands and his Feet ty'd with
Flags, or Things like Rufhes, and that he was an
European, and had Cloaths on.

There was another Tree, and a little Thicket
beyond it, about fifty Yards nearer to them than
the Place where I was, which, by going a little Way
about, I law I might come at undifcoverVl, and
that then I lhould be within half Shot of them \ fo
I with-held my Paffion, though I was indeed en-
raged to the higheft Degree, and going back about
twenty Paces, I got behind fbme Bufhes, which held
all the Way, till I came to the other Tree 5 and then
I came to a little rifing Ground, which gave me a

fbll



[ *77 3

full View of them, at theDiftance of about eighty
Yards.

t had now not a Moment to lofe •, for nineteen
of %he dreadful Wretches fate upon the Ground, all
clofe huddled together, and had juft fent the other
two to butcher the poor Chriflian, and bring him,
perhaps, Limb by Limb to their Fire-, and they
were ftoop'd down to untie the Bands, at his Feet :
I turned to Friday \ Now, Friday, faid I, do as I bid
thee * Friday faid he would $ then, Friday* fays I,
do exactly as you fee me do, fail in nothing •, fb 1
let down one of the Mufkets and the Fowling-

Aim at the Savages, bidding him do the like $ then
alking him, If he was ready ? he faid, Yes $ then
fire at them, laid I •, and the fame Moment I fir'd
alfo.

Friday took his Aim fb much better than I, that
on the Side that he fhot, he kill'd two of them,
and wounded three more •, and on my Side, I kilFd
one, and wounded two : They were, you may be
fure> in a dreadful Confterfcatiort •, and all of them,
who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their Feet,
but did hot immediately know which Way to run,
or which Way to look •, for they knew not from
whence their Deftru&ion came: Friday kept his
Eyes clofe upon me, that as I had bid him, he
might obfttfvte what I did \ fb, as foon as the firft
Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and took
up the Fowling-Piece, and Friday did the like •, he

ing like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miferably
wounded, moft of them $ whereot three more fell
quickly after, though not quite dead.

Now, Friday y fays I, laying down the difcharg'd
Pieces, and taking up the Muiket, which was yet
loaden, follow me, lays I •, which he did, with a
great deal of Courage $ upon which I rufh'd out of
the Wood, and fhew d my fel£ and Friday clofe at
my Foot : As (bon as I perceiv'd they few me, I
fhouted as loud as I could, and bad Friday do fo
too ; and running as fail as I could, which by the
way was net very f aft, being loaden with Arms as I
was, I made diredtly towards the poor Vi&im, who
was, as I faid, lying upon the Beach, or Shore,
between the Place where they fat and the Sea 5
the two Butchers, who were juft going to work
with him, had left him, at the Surprize of our ftrft
Fire, and fled in a terrible Fright to the Sea-fide,
and had jump'd into a.Guroe, and three more of the
reft made the fame Way : I turned to Friday, and
,bid him ftep forwards, and fire at them 5 he under-
ftood me immediately, and running about forty
Yards to be near them, he fliot at them, and I
thought he had kilfd them all 2 for I fee them all
fall of a Heap into the Boat •, though I few two of
them up again quickly : However, he kilPd two
of them, and wounded the third $ fo that he lay
down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had been
dead.

While my Man Friday fir'd at them, I pull'd out
my Knife, and cut the Flags that bound the poor'
Vi&im •, and lpofing his Hands and Feet, I lifted
him up, and aflt'd him in the Portuguefe Tongue,
What he was? He anfwer'd in. Latin, Cbriftianus j
but was fo weak and faint, that lie could fcarce

ftand,



[ 2 79 ]

ftand or fpeak •, I took my Bottle out of my Poc-
ket, and gave it him, making Signs that he fhould
dyink, which he did *. and Igav^ him a Piece of
Bread, which he eat - ? then t afk'd him, What
Countryman hie was? And he faid, Efpag7iiok^ and
being a little recovered, let me know by all the
Signs he could poffibly make, how much he was
in my Debt for his Deliverance • Seignior, faid I»
with as much SpaniJI) as I could make up, we will
talk afterwards, but we muft fight now * if. you
have any Strength left, take this Piftol and Sword,
and lay about you. He took them very thankfully,
and no fooner had he the Arms in his Hands, but
as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew
upon his Murderers like a Fury, and had cut two
of them in Pieces in an inftant ^ for the Truth is,
as the whole was a Surprize to them, fo the poor
Creatures were fo much frighted with the Noife cf
our Pieces, that they fell down for meer Amaze-
ment and Fear, and had no more Power to at-
tempt their own Efcape, than their Flefli had to
refill: our Shot •, and that was the Cafe of thofe five
that Friday ftiot at in the Boat •, for as three of
them fell with the Hurt they received, fb the other
two fell with the Fright.

I kept my Piece in my Hand ftill, without firing,
being willing to keep my Charge jready, becaufe I
had given the Spaniard my Piftol and Sword $ fo I
call 'a to Friday, and ba^e him run up to the Tree
from whence we firft , fir d,' and fetch the Arms
which lay there, that had been difcharg'd, which
he did with great Swiftiiefs * and then giving him
my Mufket, I fat down my felf to. load all the reft
again, and bade them come to me when they grant-
ed: While I was loading, thefe Pieces, ,t|jq , e. : .hap-
pen'd a fierce Engagement between the Spaniard
apd one of the Savages, who made at hirii with one of

T 4 theit



[ 2 8o ]

<heir great wooden Swords, the fame Weapon that
was to have kilFd him before, if I had not prevent-
ed it : The Spaniard, who was as bold and as brave
as could be imagined, though weak, had fought
this Indian a good while, and had cut him two
great Wounds on his Head ; but the Savage being
a ftout lufty Fellow, doling in with him, had
thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing
jny Sword out of his Hand, when the Spaniard, tho
undermoft,wifely quitting the Sword, drew the Piftol
from his Girdle, (hot the Savage through the Body,
and kill'd him upon the Spot, before I, who was
running to help him, could come near him.

Friday being now left to his Liberty, purfu'd the
flying Wretches with no Weapon in his Hand, but
his Hatchet j and with that he difpatch'd thofe
three, who, as I faid before, were wounded at firft
and fall n, and all the reft he could come up with \
and the Spaniard coming to me for a Gun, I gave
him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he
purfu d two of the Savages, and wounded them
both 5 but as he was not able to run, they both got
from him into the Wood, where Friday purlud
them, and kilTd one of them \ but the other was too
nimble for him •, and though he was wounded, yet
had plungM himfelf into the Sea, and fwam with
all his might off to thofe two who were left in the
Canoe, which thitee in the Canoe, with one woundr
ed, who' we know not whether he dy'd or no, were
all that efcap'd our Hands of one and twenty : The
Account of the reft is as follows *

3 Kiird at out firftShot from the Tree.

2 Kill'd at the next Shot.

2 Kill'd by Friday in the Boat.

2 Kill'd by Ditto, of thofe at firft wounded.

I Kill'd by Ditto, in the Wood.

3 Kiird by the Spaniard.

4 Kill'd, being found dropp'd here and there of
their Wounds,, or kill'd by Friday in his Chace
of them.

4 Efcapcl in the Boat, whereof one wounded, if
not dead.

21 In all



Thofe that were in the Canoe, workUAprd to
get out of Gun-Shot * and tho 5 Friday dflHe two
or three Shot at them, I did not find that he hit
any of them : Friday would fain have had me took
one of their Canoes, and purftfd them* and indeed
I was very anxious about their Efcape, leaft carry-
ing the News Home to their People, they ihould
come back, perhaps, with two or three hundred of
their Canoes, and devour us by meer Multitude * fo
I confented to wrfue them by Sea, and running to
one of their Canoes, I jump a in, and bad Friday
follow me *, but when I was in the Canoe 9 I was
furpriz'd to find another poor Creature lie there a*
live, bound Hand and Foot, as the Spaniard waf ;
for the Slaughter, and almoft dead with Fear, not
knowing what the Matter was % for he had not been
able to look up over the Side of the Boat, he was
ty'd fo hard, Neck and Heels, and had been tfd fo
long, that he had really little Life in him.

I immediately cut the twifted Flags, or Rulhes,
which they had bound him with, and would hav$
help'd him up •, but he could not (land, or fpeak,
but groan d moft piteoufly, believing, it feems, ftili
that he was only unbound in order to be kill'd.

When Friday came to him, I bade him fpeak to
him, v and tell him of his Deliverance, and pulling
out jny Bpttle, made him give the poor Wretch ^

Pra*n*



Dram, which, with the News of his being deli-
vered, reviv'd him, and he fat up in the Boat * but
when Friday came to hear him fpeak, and look'd
in his Face, it would have mov'd any one to Tears,
to have feen how Friday kifs'd him, embrac d him,
huggd him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollowed, jump'd a-
bout, dancd, fung, then cry'd again, wrung his
Hands, beat his own Face and Head, and then
fung, and jump'd about again, like a diftra&ed
Creature : It was a good while before I could make
him flttyc to me, or tell me what was the Matter;
but vMft he came a little to himfelf, he told jne
that it was his Father.

It is not eafy for me to exprefs how it movM
me to fee what Extafy and filial AfFedtion had
work'd in this poor Savage, at the Sight of his Fa-
ther, and of his being delivered from Death * nor
indeed can I defcribe half the Extravagancies of his
Affe&ion after this •, for he went into the Boat and
out of the Boat a great many times : When he
vent in to him, he would fit down by him, open
bis Breaft, and hold his Father's Head clofe to his
Bofom, half an Hour together, to nourifh it 5 then
he took his Arms and Ankles, which were numb'd
and ftiff with the Binding, and chaffed and rubbed
them with his Hands •, and I perceiving what the
Cafe was, gave him fome Rum out of my Bottle,
to rub them with, which did them a great deal of
Good.

This Aftion put an End to our Purfuit of the
Canoe, with the other Savages, who were now
gotten almoft out of Sight ^ and it was happy for
us that we did not -, for it blew fo hard within two
Hours after, and before they could be gotten a"
Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing fo
hard all Night, and that from the North Wefc
which was againft them, that I could not fiippofe

their



I i8 3 ]

their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
their own Coaft.

But to return to Friday ? he was fo bufy about
his Father, that I could not find in my Heart to
take him off for fome Time : But after I thought
he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me,
and he came jumping and laughing, and pleas'd to
the higheft Extream* then I aftfd him, Ii he had
given his Father any Bread ? He {hook his Head,
and faid, None: Ugly Dog eat all up felfy fo I gave
him a Cake of Bread out of a little Pouch JMarryd
on Purpofe ; I alfo gave him a Dram fp^Brofelf,
but he would not tafte it, but carry'd it. to his Fa-
ther : I had in my Pocket alfo two or three Bunches
of my Raifins, fo I gave him a Handful of them
for his Father. He had no fooner given his Fa-:
ther thefe Raifins, but I faw him come out of the
Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch'd*
be run at fuch a Rate * for he was the fwifteft Fel*
low of his Foot that ever I faw ; I fay, he mn at
fuch a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,
in an Inftant * and though I call'd and hollow <1
too after him, it was all one, away he went, and
in a Quarter of an Hour, I faw him come back a-
gain, though not fo fail as he went $ and as he
came nearer, I found his Pace was flacker, becaufe
he had fbmething in his Hand.

When he came up to me, I found he had been
quite Home for an Earthen Jugg, or Pot, to bring
his Father fome freih Water, and that he had got
two more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread : The Bread
he. gave me, but the Water he carry 'd to his Father :
However, as I was very thirfty too, I took a little
Sup of it. This Water teviv'd his Father more
than all the Rum or Spirits I had given him * for
he was juft fainting with Thirft.

When



[ **4 ]

When his Father had drank, I call'd to him to
know if there was any Water left -, he faid, Yes -,
and I bad him give it to the poor Spaniard,
who was in as much Want *of it as his Father j
and I fent one of the Cakes, that Friday brought,
to the Spaniard too, who was indeed very weak)
and was repofing himfelf upon a green Place, under
the Shade of a Tree, and whcfe Limbs were alio
very ft iff, and very much fwell'd with the rude
Bandage he had been ty'd with. When I faw that
upon Fridays coming to him with the Water, he
fat up and drank, and took the Bread, and be-
gan to eat, I went to him, and gave him a Handful
of Raifins * he look'd up in my Face with all the
Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfiilnefs that could
appear in any Countenance •, but was fo weak, not-
withftanding he had fo exerted himfelf in the Fight,
that he could not ftand up upon his Feet ^ he try'd
to do it two or three Times, but was really not
able, his Ankles were fo fwellM and fo painful to
him •, fo I bad him fit ft ill, and caufed Friday to rub
his Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, as he had
done his Father's.

I obferv'd the poor affe&ionate Creature every
two Minutes, or perhaps lefs, all the while he
was here, turn'd his Head about, to fee if his Fa-
ther was in the fame Place and Pofture as he left
him fitting*, and at laft he found he was not to
be feen •, at which he ftarted up, and without
fpeaking a Word, flew with that Swiftnefs to him,
that one could fcarce perceive his Feet to touch
the Ground, as he went : But when he came, he
only found he had laid himfelf down to cafe his
Limbs 5 fo Friday came back to me prefently, and
I then fpoke to the Spaniard to let Friday help
him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and
then he fhould carry him to our Dwelling, where

I would



1 would take Care of him : But Friday, a krffy
ftrong Fellow, took the Spaniard quke up upon
his Back, and carry 'd him away to the Boat, and
fet him down foftly upon the Side or Gunnel; of the
Canoe> with his Feet in the Infide of it, and then
lifted hin> quite in, and let him dole to. his Fa-
ther, and prefenjtly flapping out again, launched
the Boat off, and paddlod.it along the Shore fafter
tfen I could walk, tho' the Wind blew pretty-
hard too j fo he brought them both, fafe into our
Creek * and leaving them in the Boat, ltrns away
to fetch the other Ca&oe. A3 he: jtofift nbe, I
fpoke to him, and aft'd him, whither he wear,
he told me, Gp fetch mqte Boat $ fo away he went,
like, the Wind 5 for fare never Man or Horfe ran
like him, and be had the other Canoe in the Creek,
almoft as foon as I got to it by Land $ & he wafted
me over, and then went to help our new Gueffat
out of the Boat, which he did * but they were nei-
ther of them able to walk * So that poor Friday*
knew not what to do.

. To remedy this, I wftat to work in my Thought,
and calling to Fridayto bid them, lit down on the
Bank while he came to me^ I fooa made a Kind
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and Friday and I
carry U them up both together upon it between us :
But when we got them to theOutfide of our Wall,'
or Fortification, we were at a worfe Lofs than be-
fore * for it was impoflible to get them over * and
I was refblvd not to break it down 2 So I fet to
Work, again * and Friday and I, in about two Hours
Time, made a very handfome Tent, cover'd with
old Sails, and above that with Boughs of Trees,
being in the Space without our outward Fence,
and between that and the Grove of young Wood
which I had planted : And here we made them two
Beds of fuch Things as I had (viz.) of good Rice-
Straw,



Straw, with Blanket* laid upon it to lye on, and
t another to cover them on each Bed.

My Ifland was now peopled, and I thought my
Telf very rich in Subjects $ and it was a merry Re-
tfledtion which I frequently made, How like a King
I look'd. Firft of all, the whole Country was my
own meer Property ; fo that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion. 2<Wy, My People were per-
fedtly fubje&ed : I was abfblute Lord and Law-
giver ; they all ow'd their Lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives, if there bad been Oc-
cafion of h, tor me. It Was remakable too, we had
but three Subje&s, and they were of three different
Religions. My Man Friday was a Proteffapt, his
Father was a Pagan and a Qnt$6bal y and the Spaniard
was a Papift : However, I allow'dl-iberty qf Con-
science throughout my Dominions : But this lis by
the Way.

As foon as J had fecur'd my two weak refcued
Prifoners, and given them Shelter Jafid. a Place to
reft them upon, I began to think of rabking fbme
Provifion for them : And the firft Thing I did, I
Sfder'd Friday to take a yearling Goat, betwixt a
Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock, to
be kiird : When I cut off the hinder Quarter,, and
chopping it into fmall Pieces, I fet Friday to Work,
to boiling and ftewing, and made them a * very
good Difh, I allure you, ot Flefti and Broth, ha-
ving put fome Barley and Rice alio into the
Broth •, and as I cookM it without Doors, for I
made no Fire within my inner Wall, fo I cany'd
it all into the new Tent * and having f^t a Table
there for them, I fat down and eat my Own Din-
ner alfo with them, and, as well as I gmlcL, chear'd
them and encouraged them : Fridaybemg my Inter-
preter, efpecially to his Father, aiidy itideed, to the



■ C **? 3

. Spaniard too*, for the Spaniard fpoke the Language
of the Savages pretty well.

After we had dined, or rather fupped, I ordered
Friday to take one of the Canoes, and go and
fetch our Muikets and other Fire- Arms, which for
Want of Time we had left upon the Place of Battle *
and the next Day I order d him to go and bury
the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay open to
the Sun, and would presently be offensive) and I
alfo ordered him to bury the horrid Remains of
their barbarous Feaft, which I knew were pretty
much, and which I could not think of doing my
felf ^ nay, I could not tear to fee them, if I went
that Way : All which he pun&ually performed, and
defac'^the very Appearance of the Savages being
there -, fo that when I went again, I could fcarce
know where it was, otherwife than by the Corner
of the Wood pointing to the Place.

•I then began to enter into a little Converfation
with my two new Subjects * and firft I fet Friday
to enquire tf bis Father, what he thought of the
Efcape of the Savages in that Canoe, and whether we
mignt expeft a Return of them with a Power to^
great for us to refill : His firft Opinion was, that
the Savages in the Boat never could live out theStorm
which blew that Night thej went off, but muft of
Neceffity be drown a or driven South to thofe other
Shores, where they were as fure to be devoured as
they were to be drown'd if they were caft away;
but as to what they would do if they came fafe 8n
Shore, he faid he knew not •, but it was his Opini-
ou that they were fo dreadfully frighted with the
Mariner of their being attack'd, the Noife and the
Fire, that he believ d they would tell their People,
they were all kilFd by Thunder and Lightning, not
by the Hand. of. .Man, and^ that the two which
appeared, (viz.) Friday and me, were two Heavenly.

Spirits



t .88 ]

Spirits ot Juries, come down to deftroy them, and
not Men with Weapons: This he faid he knew,
becaufe he heard them all cry out fo in their Lan-
guage to one another * for it wax impoifible to them
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and fpeak
Thunder, and kill at a Diftance without lifting up
the Hand, as was done now : And this old Savage
was in the right * for, as I underftood fince by
others Hands, the Savages never attempted to go o-
ver to the Ifland afterwards * they were fb terrified
with the Accounts given by thpfe four Men, (for it
fcems they did efcape the Sea) that they believ'd
whoever went to that enchanted Ifland would be
deftroy'd with Fire from the Gods.

This however I knew not, and therefore was un*
der continual Apprehenfions for a good while, and
kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Army 3
for as we were now four of us, I would have ven*
tur'd upon a hundred of them fairly in the open
Field at any Time.

In a little Time, however, no more Canoes ap*
pearing, the Fear of their Coming wore offhand
I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage
to the Main into Confideration, being likewife a£
fur d by Fridays Father, that I might depend upon
good Ufage firorti their Nation on his Account, if
I would go.

Butrmy Thoughts were a little fufpended, when
I:Jjad a ferious Difcourfe with the Spaniard, and
Wnen I underftood that there were fitteen more
of his Countrymen and Portvgiiefe, who having
been caft away, and made their Efcape to that
Side, liv d there at Peace indeed with the Sava-
ges, but were very fore put to it for Neceflaries,
and indeed for Life: I afk'd him all the Par-
ticulars of their Voyage, and found they were
ft Spanijb Ship bound from the Rio de la Plata

to



[ a8 9 : ]

to the Havana, being dire&ed to leave their Load*
ing there, which was chiefly Hides and Silver, and
to bring back what European Gobds tfrey could
meet with there -, that they had five Poi tvgitefe Sea-
men on Beard, ' who they took out ot another
Wreck y that five cf their own Men were drowned
when ffrft the Ship was loft, anil that thefe efcaped
thro' infiriite Dangers anfl Hazards, and .arrived al-
moftftarv^ on the Cannibal Coaft, where they ex*
pefted to have been devour'd every Moment-

He wld me, they had fotne Arms with" them,
but thef were perfe&ly ufekfs for that they had
neither Powder or Ball, the Waihing of the Sea
having fpoilYi all their Potvder, but a little, wlych
they ufea at their firft Landing to proviide tftem-
felves fome Food.

I aflul him what he thought would become of
them thtfre, arid if they had form'd no Defign of
making any Efcape ? He faid^- The)' had many
Confutations about it, but that having neither
Veflel, or Tools to build one, or Provifions of any
Kind, their Counfels always ended in Tears and
Defpair.

I aiVd him how he thought the)' would receive
a Propofal from me, which might tend towards an
Elcape : And whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done ? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd
moftly their Treachery and ill Ufage of me, if I
put my Life in their Hands * for that Gratitude was
no. inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man ^ nor
did Men always fquare their Dealings by the Obli-
gations they had received, fo much as they did
by the Advantages they expc&ed. . I told him, it
would be very hard, that I Ihouldblthe lnftrument
of their Deliverance, and that they fliould after-
wards make me their Prifoner in New Spain, vWiere
an Evglijbmajt was certain to be made a Sacri-

fice, what Neceffity, or what Accident foevcr
brought him thither : And that I had rather be de-
liver d uj> to the Savages, and be devour'd alive,
than fall into the mercilefs Claws of the Priefts, ana
be camr'd into the foquifiUon. I added, That o-
therwile I was perfwasiea, if they were all here,
we might, with fo many Hands, build a Bark large
enough to carry us all away, either to the Brafls
Southward, or to the Iflands or Spatdjb Coaft
Northward : But that if in Requital they fhould,
when I had put Weapons into their Hands,* carry
me by Force among their own People, I might lie
ill uled for my Kindnefs to them, and make my
Cafe worfe than it was before,

H^anfwer'd with ajgreat deal of Candor and In-
genuity, That their Condition was fo miferable;
and they were fo fenfible of it, that he believed
they would abhor the Thought of ufing any Man
unkindly that fhould contribute to their Delive-
rance $ and that, if I plea fed, he would go to them
with the old Man, and difcourfe with them about
it, and return again, and bring me their Anfwer:
That he would make Conditions with them' upon
their folemn Oath, That they fhould be abfolute-
ly under my Leading, as their Commander and
Captain ^ and that they fliould fwear upon the Holy
Sacraments and the Gofpel, to be true to me, and
to go to fudh Chriftian Country as that I fhould
agree to, and no other; and to be direfted wholly
and abfolutely by my Orders, 'till they were land-
ed fafely in mch Country as I intended ffend that
he would bring a Contract from them under their
Hands for that Purpofe.

Then hetc^l me, he would firft fwear to me
himfelf, That he would never ftir from me as long
as&e livM; 'till I gaVe him Orders •, and that he

would take a\y Side to the. laft Drop of. his Blood,

■ * ■ if



[ 2 $1 ]

if there fhould happen the leaft Breach of Faith a*
mong his Countrymen.

He told me, they were all of them very civil
honqft Men, and they were under the greateft Di-
flrefs imaginable, having neither Weapons or
Cloaths, nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Di-
fcretioii of the Savages •, out of all Hopes of ever
returning to their own Country $ and that he was
fiire, if I would undertake their Relief, they
would live and die by me.

Upon thefe Aflurances, I refolv'd to venture to
relieve them, if pofllble, and to fend the old Savage
and this Spavin d over to them, to treat : But when
we had gotten all Things in a Readine&to go, the
Spaniard, hunfeif ftarted an'Obje&ion,. which had
£0 muchi Prudence in it on one hand, and fo much
Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but
be Very well fatisfy'd in it •, and, by his Advice, put
off the Deliverance of his Comrades for at leaft half
a Year. The Cafe was thus :
^ He had been with us juow about a Month * du-
ring which Time I had let him fee in what Man-
ner I hai provided, with the Afliftance of Provi-
dence, for my Support •, and he faw evidently what
Stock of Corn and Rice I had laid up* which, as
it was more than fufficient for my felf, fo it was
not fufficient, at leafl without good Hufbandry,
for my Family, now it was encreas'd to ^lumber
four : ' $ut much lefs would it be fufficient, if
his Countrymen, who. were, as he faid, fourteen
ftill ali^ fhould come over •, and leaft of all
would it be fufficient, to vijflual our Veflelj if we
fhould tuil4 one, for a Voyage, to any of the Chri-
ftian Coloipes of America. Sohe tolf^n^ he thought
it would be moreadvifebta to let him and the
twq other dig and cultivate fome more Land, as
much as I comd inare Seed to fow ^ and that we

*"" V a " toould



[*9* ]

fhculd wait another Harveft, that we might have
a. Supply of Com for his Country- men when they
fnould come •, for Want might be a Temptation to
them to difagree, or not to think themfelves deli-
vered, oth?rwife than out of one Difficulty into
another. You know, fays he, the Children ofif-
rael x though they rejoyc'd . at firft for their being
delivcr'd out of Egypt , yet rebelled even againft God
himfclf that delivered them, when they came to
want Bread in the Wildernefs.

His* Caution was fo feafonable, and his Advice
fo good, that I could foot but be very well pleasM
with his Propofal, as well as I was fatisfy'd with
his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us,
as 'well as the wooden Tools we were furnifh'd
with permitted •, and in about a Month's Time, by
the End of which it wa& Seed-Time, we had gotten
as much Land cur'd and trimm'd up; as we fbw'd
•2 2 Bulhels of Barley en, and 16 Jarrs of Rice,
which was, in fhort, all the Seed we had to (pare;
nor indeed did we leave ourfelves Barley fumcient
for our own Food, for the fix Months that we had
to expecft our Crop, that is to fay, reckoning from
the Time we fet our Seed afide for (owing* for it
is not to.be fuppos'd it is fix Months in the Ground
in the Country.

Having now Society enough, and our Number
being fufnei^nt to put us out q{ Fear of the Sava-
ges, if they had come, lihlefs their Number had
been very great, we went freely all over thelfland,
where- ever we found Occafion 5 and as hra.we had
our Efcape or Deliverance upon- our Thoughts, it
was impoffibta at^leaft for me, to have the
Means of it %t of mine * to this Purpofe,
I mark'd out feveral Trees which I thought fit for
our Work, and I fet Friday and his Father to cut-
ting thfcin down ^ and then * I caus'd the Spaniard,

- • to



[ 293 ]

to whom 1 imparted uiy Thought on that Affair,
to overfee and dire& their Work. I fhew'd.them
with what indefatigable Pains I had hew'd ftiiarge
Tree, into fingle Planks, and I caus'd theixxjo. do
the like, till they had made about a-Ltozent large
Planks of good Oak v near 2 Foot broadv $ 5 Foot
long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches .thick ; .What
prodigious Labour it tcfok 1 up, any one may ima-
gine. ' ; j *<
At the fame Time I contrived to increafemy lit-
tle Flock of tame Goats as much as I 'could * and
to this Purpofe I made Friday apd the Spaniard go
out one Day, and my felf, with Friday, the nd*t
Day-, for we took ,our Turns: And by this Means
we got above 20 young Kids'to breed up with die
reft -, for when-ever we (hot the Dam, we. fav'd
the Kids; and added them to our Flock : But above
all, the Seafbn for curing the Grapes coming on,
I caus'd fuch a prodigious Quantity to be hung up
in the Sun, that I believe, had we beent at Alicant^
where the Raifins of the Sun are cured, we could
have fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels 9 and thefe* with ou*
Bread, was a great Part of our Food, and very good
living too, I allure yot* $ fo* it isan exceeding hou-?
rifhing Food. * . ■• ■ -• !

It was now Harveft, and our Crop in good Or-
der * it was not the irioft .plentiful Ehcreafe I had
feen in the Ifland, but however it was enough to
flnfwer.our End; for from our 22 Bulhels of Bar-
ley, we brought in and threflid out above 220
Bulhels v and the like ih Proportion of the Rice,
which was Store enough for our Food to the next
Harveft, thd* all the 16 Spaniards had been on Shore
with me 5 or if we had been ready for d Voyage,
it would very plentifully have viftuall'd our Ship,
to.hive carryUus to any Part of the World, that
$ to. 4ky, ©f America*

[ *94 ]

When we had thus hous'd and fecurM our Ma-
gazine of Corn, we fell to work to make more
Wicker Work, viz. great Baftets in which we kept
it $ and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous
at this Part, and often blam'd me that I did not
make fome Things for Defence, of this Kind of
Work •, but I faw no Need of it.

And now having a full Supply of Food for all
the Guefts I expedted, I gave the Spaniard Leave
to go over to the Main, to fee what he could do
with thofe he had left behind him there. I gave
him a ftridt Charge in Writing, not to bring any
Man with him, who would not firft fwear in the
Prefence of himfelf and of the old Savage, That
he would no Way injure, fight with, or attar k the
Perfon he (hould find in the Ifland, who was fo
kind to (end for them in order to their Delive-
rance i but that they would ftand by and defend
him againft all fuch Attempts, and where-ever
they went, would be entirely under and fubje&ed
to his Commands -, and that this {hould be put in
Writing, and fign'd with their Hands : How we
were to have this done, when I knew they had
neither Pen or Ink, that, indeed, was a Queftion
which we never afk'd.

Under thefe Inftru&ions, the Spaniard, and the
old Savage (the Father of Fi idaj) jvent away in one
of the Canoes, which they might be faid to come
in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prifoners to be devour d by the Savages.

I gave each of them a Mullet with a Firelock
on it, and about eight Charges of Powder and
Ball, charging them to be very good Hufbands of
both, and not to life either of them but upon uf
gent Occafion.

This was a chearfiil Work, being the firft. Mea-
fares uftd by me in View of my Deliverance for

now



c > 9J J

now 27 Years and fome Days. I gave thfcm Prdvi-
lions of Bread, and of <|ry Grapes, fufficient for
themfelves for many Days, and fufficient for all
their Country-men for about eight Days Time ^ and
wifhing them a good Voyage, I fee them go, a-
greeing with them about a Signal they fhouldhang
out at their Return, by which I (hould know them
again, when they came back, at a Diftance, before
they came on Shore.

They went away with a fair Gale on the Day
that the Moon was at Full \ by my Account in the
Month of OSober •, but as for an exa& Reckoning
of Days, after I had once loft it, I could never re-
cover it again* nor Had I kept even the Number of
Tears fb pun&ually, as to be fure that I was right,
tho', as it prov d, when I afterwards examin'j my Ac-
count, I found I had kept a true Reckoning of Years.
It was no lefs than eight Days I had waited for
them, when a ftrange and unforefeen Accident in-
tervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in Hiftory. I was faft aileep in niy Hutch
one Morning, when my Man Friday came running
in to me, and calFd aloud, Mafier, Majfer, they
are come, they are come.

Ijump'dup, and, regardlefs of Danger, I went
out as foon as I could get my Cloaths on, thro*
my little Grove, which (by the Way) was by this
Time sjrown to fye a very thick Wood : I fay, re-
gardlefs of Danger, I went without my Arms,
which was not my Cuftom to do $ but I was fur-
priz'd, when turning my Eyes to the Sea, I pre-
fently (aw a Boat at about a League and Half's Di-
ftance, Handing in for the Shore, with a Shoulder of
Mutton Sail, as they call it, and the Wind blow-
ing pretty fair to bring them in * alio I obferv'd
prefently, that they did not come from that Side
which the Shore lay on, but from the Souther-

U 4 moft



[ z 9 6 ]

moft End of the Ifland : Upon this I calFd Friday
in, and bid him lie clofe, for thefe were not the
People we looVd for, and that we might not know
yet whether they were Friends or Enemies.

In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Per-
fpe&ive-Glafs, to fee what I could make of them j
and having taken the Ladder out, Iclimb'd up to
the Top of the Hill, as I ufed to do when I was
apprehen'fivc cf any Thing, and to take my View
the plainer without being difcover'd.

I had fcarce fet. my Foot on the Hill, when my
Eye plainly difcover d a Ship lying at aii Anchor,
at about t\yo Leagues and an halt s pittance from
Hie Squtlvfouth-eaft, but not above a League and
an half From the Shoi;e. B}' my Obfervatipn it ap-
peared plainly to be an Evglijh Ship, .and the Boat
appear d to be an Evilijh Long- Boat.

I cannot exprefs the Confufion I was in, tho' the
Toy'of feeing a Ship, and one who I had Realbn to
believe was mann'd by my own Country-men, and
qonfequently Friends, was fuch as I cannot de*
fcribe •, but yet I had fbme fecret Doubts hung a-
bout me, I cannot tell from whence they came,
bidding me keep upon my Guard. In the firfi:
Place,- it occurr'd to me to confider what Bufinefa
an' EvgliJI) Ship could have in that Part of xht World,
fince it was not the Way to or from any Part of the
World; where the Evglijb had any Traffick \ and I
knew there had been no Storms to drive them in
there, as in Diftrefs-, ^rid that if they were Eng*
lijb really, it was moft probable that they were
here upon no good Defign * and that I had better
continue as I was, than fall into the Hands of
Thieves and Murderers.

Let no Man defpife the fecret Hints and Notices
pf Danger which fometimes are given him",
when he piay think there is no Poffibility of its be-



[ *97 ]

ing real. .That fuch Hints and Notices are given
us, I believe few that have made any Obfervati-
onsof Things can deny •, that they are certain Di£
coveries of an invifible World, and a Converfe of
Spirits, we cannot doubt •, and if the Tendency
of them feems to be to warn us of Danger, why
ftiould we not fuppofe they are fromfome friendly
Agent, (whether fupreme, or inferior and fubor-
dinate, is not the Queftion) and that they are gv
.ven for our Good ?

" The prefent Queftion abundantly confirms me in
the Juftice of this Reafoning * for had I not been
made cautious by this fecret Admonition, .come it
from whence it will, I had been undone inevitably,
and.in a far worfe Condition than before,, as you
will fee prefently.

I had not kept my felf long in thisPofture, but
I faw the Boat draw near the Shore, as if they
look'd for a Creek to thruft in at for the Conveni-
ence of Landing-, however, as they did not come
quite far enough, they did not fee the little Inlet
.where I formerly landed my Rafts * but run their
Boat oh Shore upon the Beach, at about half a
Mile from me, which was very happy for me $ for
otherwife they would have landed juft, as I may
fay, at my Door, and would foon have beaten me
out of my Caftle, and, perhaps, have plunderd me
of all I had.

When they were on Shore, I was fully fatifyM
that they were Englijh Men \ at leaft moft of them ^
one or two I thought were Dutch •, but it did not
prove lb : There were in all eleven Men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed, and, as I
thought, bound * and when the firft four or five of
them were jump'd on Shore, they took thofe three
out of the Boat as Prifoners: One of the three I
could perceive ufing the moft paflionate Geftures of

Entreaty,



[ *9» ]

Intreaty, Affliction and Defpair, even to a kind of
Extravagance • the other two, I could perceive,
lifted up their Hands fometimes, and appeared con-
cern d indeed, but not to fuch a Degree as the

firft-

I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and
knew not what the Meaning of it (hould be. Frv
day calFd out to me in Ertglifa as well as he could,

Mafter ! Tou fee Knglifh Mans eat Prifoner as well
as Savage Mans. Why, fays I, Friday, do you
think they are a going to eat them then ? TW, fays
Friday, They will eat them : No, no, lays I, Friday,

1 am afraid they will murder them, indeed, but
you may be lure they will not eat them.

All this while I had no Thought of what the
Matter really was * but flood trembling with the
Horror of the Sight, expe&ing every Moment when
the three Prifbners fhould be kill'd $ nay, once I faw
one of the Villains lift uj> his Arm with a greatCut-
lafh, (as the Seamen call it) or Sword, to ltrike one
of the poor Men -, an4 I expe&ed to fee him fall
every Moment, at which all the Blood in my Body
feem'd to run chill in my Veins.

I wifh'd heartily now for my Spaniard, and the
Savage that was gone with him •, or that I had a-
ny Way to have come undifcover'd within Shot of
them;*ftat I. might have refcu'd the three Men $
for 1 laH\np Fire- Arms they had among them 5 but
it fell out to my Mind another Wa) r .

After I had ofcferv'd the outragionsUfage of the
three Men by th& infolent Seamen, I obferv'd the
Fellows run fcattering about the Land, as if they
wanted to fee the Country : I obferv d that the
three other Men had Liberty to go alfo whers they
pleas'd } but they fate down all three upon the
Ground very penfive, and lbok'd like Men in
Defpair.

This



[ 299 ]

This put me in Mind of the firft Time when I
came on Shore, and began to look about me ; how
I gave my felf over for loft, how wildly I look r d
round me, what dreadful Aptirenfiotis I had, and
how I lodg'd ill the Tree all Night for fear of
being devoured by wild Beads.

M I knew nothing that Night of the Supply J
was to receive by thd providential Driving of the
Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by
which I have fince been fo long nourilh'd and fup-
portid *, fo thefe three poor defolate Men knew no-
thing how certain of Deliverance and Supply they
were, how near it was to them, and how effectu-
ally and really they were in a Condition of Safety,
at the fame Time that they thought themfelves loft,
and their Cafe defperatc

So little do we fee before us in the World, and
To much Reafon have we to depend chearfully upon
the great Maker of the World, that he does not
leave his Creatures Co abfolutely deftitute, but that
in the worft Circumftances they have always fome-
thing to be thankful for, and fome times are nearer
their Deliverance than they imagine $ nay, are eveft
brought to their Deliverance by the Means by
which they feem to be brought to their Deftru-
ftion.

It was juft at the Top of Hi^h-Water wfcen thefe
People came on Shore, and while partly they ftood
prlying with the Prisoners they brought, and part-
ly while they rambled about to fee what kind of a
Place they were in, they had calelefly (bid till the
Tide was fpent, and the Water-was ebb^d cohfidera-
bly away, leavinjg their Boat a-ground.

They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I
found afterwards, having drank a little too much
Brandy, fell a-fleep •, however, one of them waking
fodftdr than the other, and finding the Boat too fait

a-grouad



[ 3©o ]

.aground for him to flir it, hollow'd for thereft
who were draggling about, upon which they all
; foon came to the Boat ^ but it was pad all their
Strength to launch her, die Boat being very heavy,
and the Shore on that Side being a loft oufy Sand,
almofl: like a Quick-Sand. .

In this Condition, like true Seamen, who are, per-
haps, the lead of all Mankind given to Fore-thought,
they gave it over, and away they ftrolFd about the
.Country again ; and I heard one of them fey aloud
jto another, (calling them off from the Boat), JTiy,
Jet her alow, Jack, eai§.tjy$ y JlxM float next Tide $ by
which I was fully confirmed in the main Enquiry,
Of what Countrymen they were?

All this while I kept myfelf very clpfe, not once
daring to ftir out of my Caftle, any farther than to
my Place of Obfervation, near the Top of the Hill-,
and very glad I was, to think how well it was fbrti-
fy'd : I knew it was no lels than ten Hours before
the Boat could be on float again, and by that Time
it would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty
to fee their Motions, and to heaac their Difcourfe, if
they had any.

In the mean Time, J fitted myfelf upfor a Bat-
tle, as before ,-, tho' with more Caution, knowing
I had to do with another Kind of Enemy than I had
at firft : 1 ordered Friday alfo, who I had made an
excellent. Markf man with his Gun, to load him-
felf with Arms : I took myfelf two Fpwling-Pieces,
and I gave him three Mufkets. My Figure^ indeed,
was very fierce * I had- my. formidable Goat- flan
Coat on, with the great Cap I have mentioned, a
naked Sword by my Side, two Piftols in my Belt,
and a Gun upon each Shoulder. ' *

It was my Defign, as I faid above, not to h#ve
made any Attempt 'tijl it was dark: But about
two a-Clock, being the Heat of tjie Day, I'/pund

that ift ffiort ttey- were all gone ftraggling into the
Woods, 'and, as! tTiought, were laid down to Sleep*
THe three poor diftrefTed Men, too anxious fortheir
GxmdiHon to get '?thy Sleep, ; were, however, fet
do^n tinder the Shelter of a great ^Tree, at about
a quarter of a Mile ftam me, and, as I thought, out
of Sight of any of the reft.
'' l Vntm this I relbtv'd t6 difcover my felf to them,
and learn fomething of their Condition : Immedi-
ately I jnarch'd in the Figure as above, niyjMan
Friday at agbod Diftance behind me, as formidable
for his Ahns»ast, but not making iquite fo flaring
a SptBre-like Figure as I did.

I came as near theni undifcoyer'd as I could.
ari<J then before any of them faw me, I call'd aloud
to them in Spamjb, Wb'at art ye Gentlemen ?

They ft&rted lip at the Noife, but were ten
times more confounded when they faw me, and
the uncouth Figure that I made. They iriade no
Anfwer at all-, but I thought I perceived them juft
going to fly from me, when I fpoke to them in
Ertglijh: Gentlemen, f?id I, do not be furprizd at

The.'poor Man; with Tears running down his

Face, and trembling, looking like brie aftonifh'd,

returned, Am I talking to God, or Man ! Is it a real

Our Cafe, faid he, Sir, is too long to tell you,
while our Murderers are fo near* but, in fhort,
Sir, 1 was Commander of that Ship, ray Men
have mutiny^' againft me, they have been- hard-
ly prevailed x>n not to murder me, and at kft
have fet me on Shore in this defolate Place, with
thefe two Men with me, one my Mate, the other
a PafTenger, where we expected to perifh, believ-
ing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet
what to think of it.

Where are thofe Brotes, your Enemies, faid 1 $
Do you know where they are pone ? There they l)e,
Sir, faid he, pointing to a Thicket of Trees, mj
Heart trembles for fear they have feen us, and heard
you /peak ; if they have, they wiU certainly murder w
all.

Have they any Fire- Arms, faid I ? He anfwer'd,
they had only two Pieces, and one which they
left in the Boat. Well then, faid I, leave the reft
to me •, I fee they are all afleepj it is an eafy
thing to kill them all •, but fhall we rather take
them Prifoners ? He told me, there were two de*
fperate Villains among them that it was fcarce
fafe to fhew any Mercy to $ but if they were fe-
cund, he believd all the reft would return to
their Duty. I afk'd him, which they were ? He'
told me, he could not at that Diftance defcribe
them \ but he would obey my Orders in any thing

I would



"['3°*]

I would direQ: Well, fays I, let us retreat out of
their View* or Hearing,, leaft they awake, and w$
will refolve feather •, fo they willingly went back

deliverance, arje ; ybu \villing to make two Condi T
tfens ;; withjn3ie;i he anticipated my"Propplal$, by;
telling me,; th^ kith he and the IShip,; it recoyer'd,
foould be wholly dirs&ed and commanded by m^
in every thing $ aricT if the^.Ship was not recovered,
he, would live and die with me in- what Part of the
World foever I would fend him 5 and the two othes
Men feid the fame. . '

Well j fays I, my Conditions are but two. 1. That
while yourftay on this Ifland with me, you will not
pretend to any Authority here ^ and if I put Arms
into your Hands, you will upon all Occafions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine*
upon tnis Ifland, and in the mean time be govern'd
by my Orders.

2. That, if the Ship is, or may be recover'i
you will carry me and my Man to England Pair
fage-free.

He gave me all the Afliirances that the Invention
and Faith of Man could devife, that he would com-

Sly with thefe mdl reafonable Demands, and b&»
des would owe His Life to me, and acknowledge
it upon all Occafions as long as he liv'd.

Well then, faid I, here are three Mufkets for
you, with Powder and Ball -, tell me next what you
think is proper to be done. He fcewed all th$
Tefthnony of. hifl Gratitude that he was able *
but ofier'a to be wholly guideclby me. I told him,
I thought it was hard venturing any Thing $ but
' the belt Metho4 .1 could think : of was to fire upon
them . at once, as they lay ^ and if any was not
ilill!(J at the fifft Volley, and offered ,to fubmit,
« .-' « ' we



[ 3°4 ]

we might fave them, and fo put it wholly upon
God's Providence to dirett the Shot.

He fa id very medeftly, That he was loth to
kill them, if he could help it j but that thofe two
turere incorrigible Villains^ and had been the Au-
thors of all the Mutiny in the Ship; and if they
efcaped, we fhould be undone ftill s ; for they would
go on Board, and bring the whole Ships Com-
pany, and deftroy us all. Well tben r (ays I, Ar-
ceffit y legitimates my Advice • . far it is the <mh
Way to fave ovr. Lives. However, feeing him ftill
cautious of (bedding Blood, 1 told him they Ihould
go themfelves, and manage as they found con-
venient.

In the Middle of this Dilcourfe we heard fome
Tf them awake, and foon after we law two of
them on their Feet. I afk'd him, if either of them
were the Men who he had faid were the Heads
of the Mutiny ? He faid, No : Well then, faid I,
you may let them efcape, and Providence feems to
have waken'd them on Purpofe to fave themfelves.
Now, fays I, if the reft efcape you, it is pur
Faulty . .

Animated with this, he took the Mufket I
had given him in his Hand, and a Piftol in
his Belt, and his two Comrades with him, with
each Man a Piece in his Hand. The two Men
who were with him going ; firft, made fonie
Noife, at which one of. the Seamen, who" was
awake, turn'd about, and feeing them coming,
cry'd out to the reft -, but it was too late then •, for
the Moment he cry'd out, they fir'd * I mean the two
Men, the Captain wifely referving his own Piece :
They had fo well aim'd their Shot at the Men they
knew, that one of them was kill'don the Spot, and
■the other very much wounded * but not being dead,
he ftarted up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly for

Help,



help to the other * but the Captain ftepping to him,
told him, 'twas too late to cry for Help, he fhould
rail upon God to forgive his Villany, and with that
Work knocked him down with the Stock of his
Mufket * fo that he never fpoke more : There were
three more in the Company, and one of them was
alio flightly wounded : By this Time I was come *
and. when they faw their Danger, and that it w^»
in vain to refill, they begs^d for Mercy : The Cap-
tain told them, he would ipare their Lives, if they
would-give him any Aflurance of their Abhorrence
of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
fwear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship^
and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica,
irom whence they came : They gave him all the
Proteftations of their Sincerity that could be defir d,
and he was willing to believe them, and fpare their
Lives, which I was not againft •, only I oblig 1 d him
to keep thembound Hand and Foot while they were
upon the Ifland.

While this was doing, I lent Friday with the
Captain's Mate to the Boat, with Orders to fecure
her, and bring away the Oars and Sail, which
they did $ and by and by, three ftraggling Men that
were (happily for them) parted from the reft, came
back upon hearing the Guns fir'd, and feeing their
Captain, who before was their Prifoner, now their
Conoueror, they fubmitted to be bound ajfo, and
Jo our Yiflory was compleat.

It now: remain d, that the Captain and I fhould
enquire into one another's Grcumftances : I began
firft, and told him my whole Hiftory, which he
heard with an Attention evm to Amazement, and
particularly 4t the wonderfra Mannerof my being
Qrnifh'd with, Provifions and Ammunition •, ano£
indeed, as my Story is a whole ColleSioh of Won-
dm, it affected him deeply * but whwi he reffcaed

X from



{• 5 oS ]

from thence upon himfelf, and how I fcem'd td
have been preferv d there on purpofe to fave his
Life,, the Tears ran down his Face, and he could
nor fpeak a Word more.

After this Communication was at an End, I car-
ry 'd him and his two Men into my Apartment,
leading them in juft where I came out, viz. at the
" Top ot the Houfe, where I refrefh'd theni with
Tuch Provifions as I had, and fhew'd them all the
Contrivances I had made, during my long, long,
inhabiting that Place,

All I Ihew'd them, all I faid to them, was per-
fectly amazing * but above all, the Captain admir'd
my Fortification, and how perfectly I had conceal'd
my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having
been now planted near twenty Years, and the Trees
growing much fatter than in Enghnd y was become
a little Wood, and fo thick, that it was unpaflable
in any Part of it, but at that one Side, where I
had referVd my little winding Paflage into it : I
told him, this was my Caftle and my Refidence^
but that I had a Seat in the Country, as moft Prin-
ces have, whither I could retreat upon Occafion,
and I would fhew him that too another Time •,
but at prefent our Bufinefs was to confider how to
recover the Ship : He agreed with me as to that 5
but told me, he was perfe&ly at a Lofs what Mea-
fures to take ^ for that there were ftill fix and twen-
ty Hands on Board, who having euter'd iato a
curfed Confpiracy, by which they had all forfeited
their Lives to the Law, would be hardened in it
now by Defperation * and would carry it on, know-
ing that if the)' were reducd, they fhould be
brought to the Gallows as fbon as they came to
Evghvd x or to any _ of the EvgUJb Colonies * and
that therefore there would be no attacking them
with Jfe final] a Number as we were.-

I mufed



[•307.]

I mufed for fbme Time upon what he had faid,
and found it was a very rational Conclufion ^ and
that therefore fomething was to be refolvd on ve-
ry fpeedily, as well to draw the Men on Board in-
to fomeSnare for their Surprize, as to prevent.their
Landing upon us, and deftroying us ^ upon this it
prefently oocurrd to me, that in a little while, the
Ship's Grew wondering what was become of their
Comrade9 : and of the Boat, would certainly come
on Shore in their other Boat, to fee for them, and
that thfen, perhaps, they might come arm d, and be
-. too ftrong for us ; This he allow'd was rational.

Upon this I told him, the firft Thing we had to
do, was' : to rtai ve^- the! * -Boat, > which lay ttpbn the
Beach, fo thar they might not carry her off* and
taking everything out of her, leave her fo far ufelefs
as not to be fit to fwim* accordingly we went on
Board; took the Arms which were left on Board,
out of her^ aiid . whatever elfe we found ■ there,
which was a Bottle of Brandy, and another of
Rum, a few Bi(ket-Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump bf Sugar, 'in a Piece of Canvas •, the
Sugar was five or fix Pounds-, all which was
very welcomes to me,- efpecially the Brandy and
Sugar, of which I had had none left for many
Years.

When we had carry'd all thefe Things on Shore*
(the Oars, Maft, Sail, and Rudder oi the -Boat,
were carry 'd away before, as above) we knoek'd a
great Hole in the Bottom, that if they had come
ftrong enough to matter us, yet they could not car-
ry off the Boat.

Indeed, it Was not much in my Thoughts, that
we craild be able to recover the Ship * but myTiew
tvas, tnat if they went a way without the Boat,! did
not much queftion to make her fit again, to carry us
away for the Leeward -Ifini&s, and call upon onr

Friends the Spdniards, in my Way, for I had them
ftill in my Thoughts.

While we were thus preparing our Defigns, and
had firft, by main Strength, heav'd the Boat up
upon the Beach, fo high that the Tide would not
fleet her off at High- Water-Mark, and, befides,
had broke a Hole in her Bottom, too lug to be
quickly ftopp'd, and were fat down muling what
we (hould do, we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and
few her make a U aft with her Antient, as a Signal
for the Boat to comb on Board •, but no Boat ftirr'd ;
and they fir' d feveral times, making other Signals
for the Boat.

At laft, when all their Signals and Firings provr'd
fruitlefs, and they found the Boat did not ftir, we
law them, by the Help of my Glafles, hoift another
Boat out, and row towards the Shore $ and we
found as they approAchM, that there was no Ids
than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire- Arms
with them.

As the Ship lay almofi: two Leagues from the
Shore, we had a full View of them as they came,
and a plain Sight of the Men, even of their Faces,
becaufe the Tide having fet them a little to the Eaf
of the other Boat, they row'd ufc under Shore, to
come to the fame Place, where the other had land-
ed, and where the Boat lay.

By this Means, I fay, we had a full View of them,
and the Captarin knew the Perfons and Chara&ers
of all the Men in the Boat ; of whom he faid, that
there were three very honeft Fellows, who he was
fure were led into this Confpiracy by the reft, be*
ing over-powfcr'd and frighted.

But that as for the Boatfwain, who it feens was
the chief Officer among them, and all the refljthejr
were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew, and
were no doubt made defperate in their new Entec

prizes



[ 3°5> ]

prize $ and terribly apprehenfive he was, that they
would be too powerful for us*

I fmil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our
Circumftances wer$ paft the Operation of Fear :
That feeing almoft every Condition that could be
was better than that which we were fuppos'd to h*
ill, we ought to expedt that tjie Conference, whe-
ther Death or Life, would be fure to be a Delive-
rance. I afk'd him, What he thought of the Cir-
cumftances of my Life ? And, whether a Delive-
rance were not worth venturing for ? And where,
Sir, faid I, is your Belief of ipy being preferv'd here
oft- purpofe to fave your Life, which elevated you
a little while ago ? For my Part, (aid I, there fetms
to be but one Thing amjifs in all the Profpe& of it :
What's that ? fays he * why, faid 1, 5 Tis that, as you
fay, there are three or four honcfl: Fellows among
them, which fhou d be fpar'd * had they been all of
the wicked Part of the Crew, I fttould have thought
God $ Providence had fingled them out to deliver
them into your Hands $ for depend upon it, every
Man of them that comes a-ihore are our own, and
fhall die, or live, as they behave to us.

As I fpoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful
Countenance, I found it greatly encourag'd him •, fo
we fet vigoroufly to our Bufineis * We had, upon the
firft Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship,
confident of feparating our Prifoners, and had in-
deed fecur'd them effedtually.

Two of them, of whom the Captain was left at
fur'd than ordinary, I fent with Friday, and one of
the three (deKtrer d Men) to my Cave, where they ,
were remote enough, and out of Danger of being
heard or difcover a, or of finding their Way out of
the Woods, if they could have deliver d themfelves*
Here they left tliem bound, but gave them ProvifT-
ons, and promisM them if they continued there

X 3 quietly,



[i«o]

quietly, to give them their Liberty in a Day or
two •, but that if they attempted their Efcape, they
ihould be put to Death without Mercy.. They pro- -
mis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement with
Patience, and were very thankful that they had
fuch good Ufage as to have Provifions, and a Light
left them •, for Friday gave them Candles (fuch as
we made cur felves) tor their Comfort^ and they
did not know but that he ftoodCentinel over them
at the Entrance.

The other Prifoners had .better . Ufage * two of
them were kept pinion d indeed; becaufe the Cap :
tain was not freie to truft them-, but the other two.
were taken into my Service upon their Captain's
Recommendation, and upon their folemnly enga-
ging to lire and die with us * fo, with them and the
three honed Men, we were ieven Men, well arxn d •,
and I made no doubt we fhou'd be able to deal well
enough with the Ten that were a coming, confi-
dering that the Captain had faid, there were three
or four honeft Men among them alfo.

As foon as they got to the Place where their o-
thcr Boat lay, they run their Boat into the Beach,
and came all on Shore, haling the Boat up after
them, which I was glad to fee •, for I was afraid
they would rather have left the Boat at an Anchor,
funic Diflance fioin the- Shore, with fome Hands
in her, to guard her ^ and fo we Ihould not be able
to fcize thcBoat.

Being on Shore, the firit Thing they did, they
ran all to the other Boat, and -it ms eafy to fee
that they were under a great Surprize, to find her
ftripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a great
Hole in her Bottom.

After they had inus d a while upen this, they.
fet up tworr threa great Shouts, hollowing with
all their Might, to' try if they could make their

Companions



[3" 3

Companions hear •, but all was to no Purpofe :■ Then
they came all clofe in a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of
their fmall Arms, which indeed we heard, and the
Echoes made the Woods ring * but it was all one,
thofe in the Cave we were fure could not hear, and
thofe in our Keeping, though they heard it well e-
noygh, yet durft give no Anfwer to them. . '

They were fo aftonifh'd at the Surprize of this,
that as they told us afterwards, they refolv'd to go
all on Board again to their Ship, and kt them know
there, that* the Men were all murder'd, and the
Long- Boat ftav'd ^ accordingly they immediately
launch'd their Boat again, and got all of them
on Board.

The Captain was terribly amazM, and even con-
founded at this, believing they would go on Board
the Ship again and fet Sail, giving their Comrades,
for loft, and fo he fhould ftill lofe the Ship^ which
he was in Hopes we fhould have recovered'; but he
was quickly as much frighted the other way.

They had not been long put off with the Boat,
but weperceiv'd them all coming on Shore again v
but with this new Meafure in their Conduft, which
it feems they consulted together upon, viz? To
leave three Men in the Boat, and the reft to- go on
Shore, amd go up into the Country to lodk for their
Fellows. : •

This was a great Disappointment to us : for now
we were at a Lofs what to do-, for our feizing
thofe feven Men on Shore would be no Advantage
to us, if we let the Boat efcape, becaufe they would
then row away to the Ship, and then the reft of
them would be fure to weigh and let Sail,' and fo
our recovering the Ship would be loft.

However, we had no Remedy but to wait and
fee what the Iffue of Things might prefenU'The
feven Men came on Shore, and the three who re-

X 4 main'd



main'd in the Boat, put her off to a good Diftance
from the Shore, and came to an Anchor to wait for
them 5 fo that it was impofiible for us to come at
them in the Boat.

Thofe that came on Shore, kept clofe together,
marching towards the Top of the little Hill, unde?
which my Habitation lay ; and we could fee theni
plainly, tho* they could not perceive us : We
could have been very glad they would have come
nearer to us, fo that we might have fir'd at them,
or that they would have gone farther off; that wfe
might have come Abroad.

But when they were come to the Brow of the
Hill, where they could fee a great Way into the
Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the Norths
Eaft Part, and where the ifiand lay loweft, they
fhouted and hollowed till they were weary * and
not caring, it feems, to venture far from the Shore,
nor far from one another, they fat down together
under a Tree, to confider of it : Had they thought
fit to have gone to deep there, as the other Party
of them had done, they had done the Jobb for us ;
but they were too full of Apprehensions of Danger,
to venture to go to fleep, tho* they could not tell
what the Danger was they had to feir neither.

The Captain made a very juft Propofal to me,
upon this Confultation of theirs, viz. That per-
haps they would all fire a Volley again, to endea-
vour to make their Fellows hear, and that we
fhould all fally upon them, juft at the Juncture
when their Pieces were all difcharefd, and they
would certainty yield, and we Ihould have them
without Blood- (hed : I lik'd the Propofal, provided
it was done while we were near enough to come
up to them, before they could load their Pieces
again. .;..:.■:• • ;



I i > 3 ]

But this Event did not happen, and we lay ftify
* long Time, very irrefolute what Courfe to take ^
at length I told them, there would be nothing to
be done in my Opinion till Night, and then if they
did not return to the Boat, perhaps we might find
a Way to get between them and the Shore, and fo
ipnight ufelome Stratagem with them in the Boat,
to get them on Shore,

: We waited a great yrhtfe, tho 5 very in-patient
fbi; their removing, and were very uneafy* when,
after long Confyltatsons, we faw them ftart all up,
and march down toward the Sea : It feems they
had fuch dreadful Apprehenfions U|pon them, of
jhe Danger of the Place, th^t they refoly'd io go
on Board the Ship again, give their Companions
over for loft, and to go op with their intended
Voyage with the Ship.

As loon as I perceived them go tpwar^f the Shore,
J imagined it to be as it really was, That they had
given oyer thep Search, ana were for going back
again * and the Captain, as foon as I told him my
Thoughts, was ready to fink at the Apprehenfiong
of it * but I prefexitly thought of a Stratagem to
fetch them back again, and yfhkh anfwer'd my
End to a Tittle- "

I order 'd Friday, and the Captain's Mate, to go
oyer the little Greek Weft ward, towards the Place
Where the Savages came on Shore, when Friday was
irefcud-, and as foon as they came to a little riling
Ground, at about half a Mile Diftance, I bad them
hollow, as loud as they could, and wait till they
found the Seamen heard them -, that as foon as ever
they heard the Seamen anfwer them, they ihould
return it again, and then keeping out of Sight, take
a Roqnd, always anfwering when the other hollowed,
to draw them as far into die Ifland, and among the'
ff ; ai\ ' • » •; «• Woodsy



[ 3*4 ]*

Woods, as poffible, and then wheel about again to
me, by fuch Ways as I diredled them.

They were juft going into the Boat, when Fri-
day and the Mate hbllow'd, and they prefently heard
them, and anfwering, run along the Shore Weft-
ward, towards the Voice they heard, when they
were prefently flopped by the Creek, where the
Water being up, they cpuld not get over, and
call'd for the Bdat to come up, and fet them overj
as indeed I expe&ed. *

When they had fet themfelves over, I pbfery d,
that the Boat being gone up a good Way jnto the
Creek, and, as it were, in a Harbour within the
Land, they took one of the thre$ Men out of her
to go along with them, and left only two in the
Boat, havitig faften'd her to the Stump of a little v
Tree on the Shore.

' This was what I wiftvd for, and immediately
leaving Friday and the Captain's Mate to their Bufi-
nefs, I took the reft with me,' andcroffing the
Creek out of their Sight, we furpriz'd the two
Men before they were aware, one of them lying
on Sh&re, and the other being in the Boat $ the
Fellow on Shore was between f leeping and waking^
and going to ftart up, the Captain, who was fore-
moft,rari in upon him, and kriock'd him down, and
then call'd oiit to him in the Boat to yield, or he
was a dead Man.

There heeded very few Arguments to perfwade
a fingle Man to yield, wh'en he faw five Men upon
him, and his Comrade khock'd down $ befides, this
was, it feems, one of the three who were not ib hear-
ty in the Mutiriy*as the reft of the Crew, and there-
fore vras eafily perfwaded, riot, only to yield, but
afterwards to join very fincerely with- 11s.

In the mean Time, Frafay and the Captain's Mate
fi> well managed their Bufinefs with the reft, that

they

P

t&ey drew them, byHollowing and Anfwering, fronj
one Hill to another, and from one Wood to ano-
ther, 'till they not only heartily tir'dthem^ but left
them where they were very fure they could hot
reach back to the Boat before it was dark $ and in :
deed they were heartily tir'd themfelves alfo by
the Time they came back to us.

WeTiad nbthing now tb do bat to watch for them
in the Dark, and to fall upon them, fo as to make-
fiire Work with them.

It was feveral Hour? after Friday came back to
me, before they came back to their Boat •, afid we
could hear the Foremoft of them long before they
came quite up, calling to thofe behind to come
along, -and could alfo hear them ahfwer, and com-
plain how lame and tyr'd they were, and not able
to come any fafter, which was very welcoitae News
to us. ' ■' ; ;l ■ -• -

' At length they came up to the Boat $ but 'tis
impoflible to exprefs their Confufion, when they
found the Boat faft a- ground in the Creek, the:
Tide ebb'd * out, and their two Men gone : Wfe
rtould hear them call to one another in a moft te-
ipentable Manner, telling one another they wetfe
gotten into an inchanted Ifland £ that either there*
were Inhabitants in it, and they Ihould all be mur-
dered y or elfe there were Devils and Spirits in it,
and iixty Ihould be all carry'd a dray and devoured.
* : They hollow'd again, and call'd their two Come-
rades by their Names a great many Times, • but
ho Anfwer. After fomeTime, we could fee them,
by the little Light there was, run- about. wringing'
their Hands, like Men in Defpair $ . and thatfomd-
timfes they would go and fit down- in the Boat id
reft f themfelves, then cotine afhore again,, and walk'
about again, and fo the fame Thing over again. " ;



[ ? 16]

Mr Men would fain have me give them Leave
to fall upon them at once in the Dark -, but I was
willing to take them at fome Advantage, fo to
fpare them, and kill as few of them as I could y
and efpecially 1 was unwilling to hazard the kil-
ling any of our own Men, knowing the other were
very well armU I refbly'd to wait to fee. if they
did not feparate ; and therefore to make fine of
them, I drew my Ambufcade nearer, and order'd
Friday and the Captain to creep upon their Hands
and Feet as clofe to the Ground as they could,
that they might not be difcover'd, and get as netf
them as they could poiUbly, hefore they pfier d to
fire.

They had not been long in that Pofture, but that
the Boatfwain, who was the principal Ringleader
of the Mutiny, and had now (hewn hiznfelf the
moft dejefted and difpirited of all the reft, came
walking towards them with two more of theft
Crew v the Captain was fo eager, is having this
principal Rogue fo much in his Power, that he
could hajdly have Patience to let him come {b
near as t o be fure of him * for they only heard
his Tongue before : But when they came nearer,
the Captain and Friday darting up on their Feet,
let fly at them.

The Boatfwain was kill'd upon ithe Spot ; the
next Man Was fhot into the Body, and fell juft by
him, tho' he did not die till an Hour or tvfo after *
and the third run for it.

At the Noife of the Fire, I immediately ad-
yane'd with my whole Army, which was now
eight Men, viz. myfelf Generaliflimo, Friday my
t^eutenant-General, the Captain and his two Men,
and the three Prifoners of War, who we had trailed
with Arms.



t3'7]

We came upon them indeed in the Dark, fb that
they could not fee our Number * and I made the
Man they had left in the Boat, who was now one
of us, to call them bj Name, to try if I could
bring than to a Parley, and fo might perhaps re-
duce them to Terms, which fell out juft as we de-
jtr'd : For indeed it was eafy to think, as their
Gonditian then was, they would be very willing
to Capitulate ; fo he calls out as loud as he could,
to one of them, Tom Smith, Tom Smith * Tom Smith
aitfwer'd immediately, Who\ tfort, Robinfon > For
it ftems he knew his Voice : T'other anfwer d, Ay,
ay ; for God's Safa, Tom Smith, throw damn jour
Arm^ and* yield, or you are all dead Mm this Mo-
ment.

Who mnft we yield to ? Where are they? (fays Smith
again * ) Here they are, iky s he, here's our Captain,
and fifty Men with him, have been hunting you
this two Hours ; the Boatfwain is kill'd, Wttt Ft ye
is wounded, and I am a Prifoner * and if you do
not yield, you are all loft,

. Will they give us Quarter then, (fays Tom
Smith) aod we will yield ? M go and afi, if you
protnife to yield, fays Robin/on % Co he aik'd the Cap-
tain, and the Captain himfelf then calls out, You
Smithy you know my Voice, if you lay down your
Arms immediately, and fubmit, you fhall have
yqur Lives, all but Will. Atkins.

. Upon this, WiU. Atkins cry'd out, For Gud'sSake,
Captain, give me Quarter) what have I done ? They
have been all as bad as I\ which by the Way was not
true neither •, for it feems this Will Atkins was the
firft Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they
ftrft mutiny'd, and ufed him barbaroufly, in tying
his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, the Captain told him he muft lay dowp
his Arms at Difcretion, and truft to the Gover-

nour's



C-3>8]

iiouPs Mercy, by which he meant me 5 for they
all call'd me Governour.

In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and
begg'd their Lives * and I fent the Mau that had
parly'd with them, and twoincre, who bound
them all* and then my great Army of 50 Men,
which particularly with thofe three, were all but
eight, came up and fe'z'd upon them all, and up-
on their Boat, only that I kept myfelf and one
more out of Sight, for Reafons of State,

Our next Work was to repair- the Boat, and to
•think of feizing the Ship $ and as iot thfe Captain,
now he had Leifure to parly with them :' He eipo-
ftulated with them upon the Villany of thqir Bra-
ttices with him, and at length, upon the farther
Wickednefs of their Defign, and how certainly it
muft bring them to Mifery andDiftrefs in the End,
and perhaps to the Gallows.

They all appeared very penitent, and begg'd hard
for their Lives : As for that, he told them, they
were none of his Prifoners, but the Commander's of
the Ifland 5 that they thought they had fet him on
Shore in- a barren uninhabited Ifland, but it had
pleas'd God (b to diredt them, that ithe Ifland
• was inhabited, and that "the Governour was an
Evglijhman * that he might hang them all there, if
he pleas'd •, but as he had given them all Quarter,
he fuppos cl he would fend them to England, to be
dealt with there, as Juftice required, except At-
kins, who was commanded by the Governour to
advife to prepare for Death $ for that he would be
hang'd in the Morning.

Though this was all a Fi&ion of his own, yet
it had its defir'd EtFedt 5 AtkimkW upon his Knees
to beg the Captain to intercede with the Gover-
nour for his Life, and all the reft begg'd of him

for

for God's fake, that they might not be feat to'

. England. , ,

It now occurred to him, that the Time of our
Deliverance was come, and that it would be amoft
eafy. .thing to bring thefe Fellows in, , : tobe hearty
ip getting PofTeffion of the Ship * fo.I retir'd in the
Dark from them, that they mighti not fee what
. Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the Gap-
tain to! one* when. I call'd, as at a good Diftance*
one of the Men was order'd to fpeak again, and fay
to. the » Captain, Captain, the Commander calls for
jwi. apd prefently the Captain reply 'd, Tell bis
£%cellettly, I amju/ta canting: Thi^.more perfe^ly
amus'd. them* and they all belie vclthat the Com-
mander was juft by with his fifty-Men.
? Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him
jny Frcrjedt for, sizing the Ship, which he lik'd of
.wonderfully wetl^ and refolva to put it in Execu-
tion the next Morning.

, . But in Order to execute it with mere Art; and
fecure cf Succefs, I told him, we muft divide the
Prifbners, and that he fhould go and take Atkins
and twomore pf the worft of them, and fend them
pinioned to the Cave where the others lay ; This
was committed to Fa Hay and the two Men who
came on Shore with the Captain.

They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Pri-
fon * and it was, indeed, a difmal Place, efpecialiy
to Men in their Condition.
. The other I ordered to my Bower, as I call'd it,
qf which l have given a full Defcription * and as
it waVJfenc'd in, and they pinion'd \ the Place was
fe^pre enough, considering they were upon their
JJehaviour.

To thefe in the Morning I fent the Captain, who
was to enter into a Parley with them, in a Word,
to try them, and tell me, whether he thought they

might



[ 3*° ]

might be trbfted or no, to go on Board and furpnze
the Ship. He talked to them of the Injury done
him; of the Condition they were brought to; and
that though the Governonr had given them Quar-
ter for their Lives, as to the prefent Attion, yet
that if they were lent to Evgland, they would all
be hang d in Chains, to be (fire ; but that if they
would join in fo juft an Attempt, as to recover the
Ship, he would have the Govemour's Engagement
for their Pardon.

Any one may gnefs how feadily liich a Propofal
would be accepted by Men in their Condition *
they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and
promifed with the deepeft Imprecations, that they
would be faithful to him to the laft Drop, and
that they fhould owe their Lives to him, and
would go with him all over the World ; that they
would own him for a Father to them as long as
they liv'd.

Well, fays the Captain, I muft go and tell the
Governour what you fay, and fee what I can do
to bring him to confent to it : So he brought me
an Account of the Temper he found them inj
and that he verily believ d they would be faith*
ful.

However, that we might be very fecure, I told
him he fhould go back again, and chufe oat thofe
five, and tell them, they might fee that he did not
want Men ; that he would take out thole five to be
his Afliftants, and that the Governour would keep
the other two, and the three that were lent Prifb-
ners to the Caftle (my Cave) as Hoftages, for the
Fidelity of thofe five •, and that if they provd un-
faithful in the Execution, the five Hoftages fhould
be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.

This



This look' d fevere, and convinc d them that the
(Governour w;as in Earneft 5 however, they had no
tVay left them but to accept it 5 and it was now*
the Bufinefs of £he Prifoners, as much as. of the
Captain, to perfwade the other five to do then?
Duty.

Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Ex-
pedition : 1. The Captain, his Mate, and Paflenger*
2. Then the two Prifoners of the firft Gang, to
iyhpm, having their Characters from the Captain,
I had given their Liberty, and trtifted them with
Arms. $. The other two, who I had kept till now
in my BoWer, pinion'd, but, upon the Captain's
Motion, had now releas'd. 4. Thefe five releasM
at laft 5 fb that they were twelve in all, befides five
we kept Prifoners in the Cave for Hbftages.
. I klk'd the Captain, if he was willing to ven-
ture with thefe Hands on Board the Ship •, for*
as for me and my Man Friday, I did not think
it was propfer for us to ftir, having feven Men
left behirid *, and it was Employment enotigh for
lis to keep them afunder, and fupply them with
Vi&uals.

As to the five in th? Cave, t refolv d to keeji
them faft ^ but Friday went in t wide a Day to them*
to fupply them with NecefTaries^ and I made the
other two tarry Provifions to a Certain Diftahce,
where Friday was to take it.

When I Ihew'd my felf to the two Ildftages, it
\tras with the Captain, who told them, I was the
Perfbn the Governour had order'd to ldok aftef
them, land that it was the Governors Pleafure the/^
Ihould not ftir any where but by my Dire£tion$
that if they did, they ihoiild be fetch'd into the

Governour, the Garrifbn, the CafUe, and the like,
upon all Ckrafions.

The Captain now had no Difficulty before him,
bat to furniih his two Boats, flop die Breach of
one, and man them. He made his Paflenger
Captain of one, with four other Men * and him-
fell, and his Mate, and five more went in the o-
ther : And they contrivd their Bufinefs very well $
for they came up to the Ship about Midnight As
foon as they came within Call of the Ship, he made
Robittfon hale them, and tell them they had brought
off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long
Time before they had found them, and the like $
holding them in a Chat ull they came to the Ships

firft with their Arms, immediately knocked down
the fecond Mate and Carpenter with the But end

by their Men •, they fecur'd all the reft that were
upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to
fallen the Hatches to keep them down who were

at the fore Chains, fecur'd the Fore-Caftle of the
Ship, and the Scuttle which went down in the
Cook- Room, making three Men they found there
Prifoners.

When this was done, and all fafeupon Deck, the
Captain order'd the Mate with three Men to break
into the Round Houfe, where the new Rebel Cap-
tain lay -, and, having taken the Alarm, was gotten
up, and with two Men and a Boy had gotten Fire*
Arms in their Hands; and when the Mate with a
Crow fplit open the Door, the new Captain and
bis Men fud boldty among them, and wounded the
Mate with a Mulket-Ball, which broke his Ann,
and wounded two more of the Men, but kilfd no
Body.

The Mate calling for Help, rufh'd however fn-

his Piftol (hot the new Captain through the Head,
the Bullet entering at his Mouth, and came out
again behind one of his Ears* £b that he never
fpoke a Word 3 upon which the reft yielded, and
the Ship was taken effectually, without any more
Lives loft.

As foon as the Ship was thus fecur'd, the Cap-
tain order d feven Guns to be fir'd, which was the
Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
t>f his Succefs, which you may be fure I was very
jlad to hear, having fate watching upon the Shore
for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning-
Having thus heard the Sigpal plainly, I laia me
down i and it having been a Day of great Fatigue
to me, I flept Very found, till I was fomethifig fur-
priz'd with the Noife of a Gun-, and prefently
ftarting up, I heard a Man call me by the Name
of Governour, Governour, and prefently I knew the
Captain's Voice, when climbing up to the Top of
the Hill, there he flood, and pointing to the Ship,
he embrac'd me in his Arms, My dear Friend ani
Deliverer , fays he, there s your Ship, for fie is all yours,
andfo are we and all that belong to her. 1 caft my Eyes
to the Ship, and there (he rode within little' more
than half a Mile of the Shore •, for they had weigVcJ
her Anchor as foon as they were Mafters of her $
and the Weather being fair, had brought her to an
Anchor juft againft the Mouth of the little Creejc \,
and the Tide being up, the Captain had brought
the Pinnace in near the Place where I firft landed
my Rafts, and fp landed juft at my Door.

T was at firft r^ady to link down with the Sfor-
prize : . For I faw my Deliverance indeed vilibly
put into my Hands, all Things eafy, and a large
Ship juft ready to carry me away whither I plea-

fed to go. At firft, for foriie Time, I was not able
to afifwer hiln ofie Word -, but as he had taken m&
in his Arms, I held faft by him, or I fiiould have
fallen to the Ground.

He perceiv'd the Surprize, and immediately
pulls a Bottle but of his Pocket, and gave me a
Dram of Cordial, which he had brought on pur-
pofe for me* after I had drank it, I fat down up-
on the Ground * and though it brought me to my
felf, yet it was a good while before I could fpeak
a Word to him.

All this while the poor Man was in as great an
Extafy as I, only not under any Surprize, as I was*
ahd he faid a thoufand kind tender Things to me,
to eompofe and bring me to my felf* but fuch
was tlfe Flood of joy in my Breaft, that it put all
my Spirits into Confofion •, at laft it broke out
into Trails, and in a little while after I recovered
my Speech.

Then I took my Turn, and embrae'd him as
my Deliverer •, and we rejoye'd together. I told
him, I look'd upon him as a Man fent from Hea-
ven to deliver me, and that the whole Tranfa&ion
feem'd to be a Chain of Wonders * that fuch Things
as thele were the Teftimonies we had of a fecret
Hand of Providence governing the World, and an
Evidence, that the Eyes of an infinite Power could
fferrch into the remoteft Corner of the World, and
fend Help to the Miferable whenever he pleafed.

I forgot not to lift up my Heart in Thankful-
itefs to Heaven ; and what Heart could forbear to
Hefi him, who had not only in a miraculous Man-
ner provided for one in fuch a Wilderneft, and
in fur h a defolate Condition, but from whom every
Deliverance iftuft always be acknowledged to pro-
ceed ?



[ J* J ]

When we had talk'd a while, the Captain tolA
me, he had brought me fome little Refrefhwnt,
fuch as the Ship afforded, land foch as the Wretches
that had been lo long his Maftershad not plun'de/d
him of : Upon thi6 he jrall'd aloud to the Boat, and.
bid his Men bring the Things a- Shore that were for
the Governour$ and indeed it was a Prefent, as if
I had been one not that was to be carry'd away
along with them, but as if I had been to dwell
upon the Ifland ftill, and they were to go without
me.

Firft he had brought me a Cafe of Bottles fall
of excellent Cordial Waters, fix large Bottles of
Madera Wine 5 the Bottles held two Qarts apiece 5
two Pound of excellent good Tobacco, twelve good
jFJeces of the Ship's Beef, and fix Pieces of Pork,
.with a Bag of Peafe, and about a hundred Weight
of Bifket.

He brought me alfb a Box of Sugar, a Box' of
Flower, a Bag full of Lemons, and two Bottles of
Lime-juice, and abundance of other Things t But.
^efides thele, and what was a thoufarid times more
ufeful to me, he brought me fix clean new Shirts,
fix very good Neckcloaths, two Pair of Gloves >
,one Pair of §hoes, a Hat, and one Pair of Stoclo-
irigs, and 3 .very good Suit ofCloaths of his oWn,
which Jiad been worn but very little : In a Word,
he cloathed npe from Head to Foot.

It was a very kind and agreeable Prefent,asany'
one may imagine, to one in my Circnmftances :
But never was any thing in the World of that Kind
#> unpleafant, awkard, and mieafy, as it was to
me to wear fuch Cloaths at their firft putting on.

After thefe Ceremonies paft, and after all his
good Things were brought info my little Apart-
ment, we began to confiilt what was to be done
with the Prifoners we had •, for it was worth con-

fidering, whether we might venture to take then?
away with us or no, efpecially two of them, who
we Knew to be incorrigible and refraftory to the
laft Degree ^ and the Captain faid, he knew they
were fuch Rogues, that there was no obliging
them, and if he did carry them away, it muft te
in ' Irons, as Malefadtors to be deliver'd over to Ju-
ftice at the firft Evglijh Colony he could come at *
and I found that the Captain himfelf was venf
anxious about in

Upon this, I told him, that if he defied it, I
durft undertake to bring the two Men he fpoke of,
to make it their own Requeft that he fhould leave
them upon the Ifland : I jbonU be very glad of thai,
Jays the Captain, with all my Heart.

Well, fays I, I will fend for them up, and talk
with them for you -, fo I caus'd Friday and the two
Hoftages, for they were now difcharg'd, their Com-
rades having performed their Promife.^ I fay, I caii-
f ed them to go to the Cave, and bring up the five
Men pinion d, as they were, to the Bower, and
keep them there 'till I came.

After fome Time, I came thither drefs'd in my
new Habit, and now I was call'd Governour again %
being all met, and the Captain with me, I caus'd
th« Men to be brought before me, and I told them,
1 had had a full Account of their villanious Beha-
viour to the Captain, and how they had ran away
with the Ship, and were preparing to commit far-
ther Robberies, but that Providence had en-
fnar'd them in their own Ways, and that they
were falFn into the Pit which they had diggYl for
others.

I let them know, that by my Diredtion the Ship
had been feiz'd, that (he lay now in the Road, and
they might fee by and by, that their new Captairi

had received the Reward of his Villainy $ for that
they might fee him hanging at the Yard- Arm.

That as to them, I wanted to know what they
had to fay, why I fhould not execute them as IV
rates taken in the Fadt, as by my Cominiflion they
could not doubt I had Authority to do.

One of them anfwer'd in the Name of the refi^
That they had nothing to fay but this, That when
they were taken the Captain promised them their
Lives, and they humbly implor'd my Mercy : But
I told them, I knew not what Mercy to {hew them *
for, as for myfelf, I had refolv'd to quit the
Ifland with all my Men, and had taken paflage
xvith the Captain to go for England: And as for
the Captain, he coijld not carry them to England,
othpr tnan as Prifoners in Irons to be try'd for
Mutiny and running away with the Ship 5 the
Confeqqenqe of which they mud: needs know
would be the Gallows * fo that I could* not tell
which was beft for them, unlefs they had a Mind
to tafce their Fate in the Ifland * if they defir'd that.
I did not care, $s I had Liberty to leave it, I had
fome Inclination to give them their Lives, if they
thought they could lnift on Shore.

They feem'd very thankful for it, faid they
would much rather venture to ftay there, than to
be carry'd jto England to be hang*d $ fo I left it on
thatlffue.

However, the Captain feejp'd to make fome
Difficulty of it, a$ if he durft not leave them
there : Upon thi? I feeni'd a little angry with the
Captain, and told him, That they were my Prifo-
ners, not his * and that feeing I had offer d them
fb much Favour, I would be as good as my Word ;
and that if he did not think fit to confent to it, I
would #t them 3t liberty as I found them * and

if he did not like it, he might take them - again if
he could catch them.

Upon this they appear'4 very thankful, and I
accordingly fetthemat Liberty, and bade them' re-
tire into the Woods, to the Place whence they came,
and I would leave them fome Fire Arms, fome
Ammunition, a^d fome Dire&ions ho w they fliould
live very well, if they thought fit.

Upon this, I prepare! to go on Board the Ship,
tut told the Captain, that I would ftay that Night
to prepare my Things, and defir'd him to go on
Board in the mean Time, and keep all right iri
the Ship, and fend the Boat on Shore the next Day
For me-, ordering him, in the mean time, to caufe
the new Captain who was kilfd, to be hangM at .
the Yard- Arm that thefe Men might lee him. .'
When the Captain was gone, I fent for the Attn
up to me to my Apartment, and entered ferioufly
into Difcpurfe with them of their dirqimftances ^
I told tfifem, I thought they had made a right
Choice * that if the Captain .carry'd them away,
they would certainly be hang'd. I ftiew?d them
the new Captain, hanging at the Yard Arm of the
Ship, and told them they had nothing left to expeift.
When they had all declar'd their Willingnefe W
ftay, I then told them, I would let them into the
Story of my living there, and put them into the
Way of making it eafy to them. Accordingly I
gave them the whole Hiftory of the Place, and of
my coining t6 it * (hew'd them my Fortifications,
the Way I made my Bread, planted my Corn, cu-
red my Grapes ^ and in a Vord, all th^t was ne-
tefTary to make them eafy: I told them the Story
alfo of the fixteefl Spaniards that were to be exped-
eft ; for whdm I left a tetter, and made them pro-
mife to treat them in commoa with themfelves. J

I left them my Fire Arms, viz. Five Muffeets,
jthree Fowling Pieces, and three Swords. I had
above a Barrel and half of Powder left ; for after
the firffc Tear or two, I usd but little, and wafted
none, I gave them a Description of the Way I
pianag'd the Goats, and Directions to milk and
fatten them, and tp make both Butter and Cfreefe.
' . In a Word, I gave jhem every Part of my owi*
Story j jind I told Jnenj, I would prevail with the
Captain to leave them tyto Barrels of Gprj-Powder
more, and fbme Garden- Seeds, which I told them
I would have been very glad of \ alfo I gave them
the Bag of Peafe which the Captain had brought
me to eat, and bade them be furg to fow and en-
erg a(e them. '

Having done ajl this, I left them the next Day,
and went on Board the Ship : We prep^r'd imme-
diately to fail, but did not weigh that Night :
The next Morning early, two of the fiye fylen
came fwimming to the Ship's Side, and making a
moft lamentable Complaint of the other three,
J>egg\l to be taken into the Ship, for God's Safce,
for they ftiou d be murder'd, and begg'd the Cap-
tain to take them on Board, tho' he hang'd them
immediately.

Upon this, the Captain pretended to have no
Power without me \ but after fome Difficulty, and
after their foleipn Promifes of Amendment, they
were tajcen on Board, and were fome \ ime aftp ?
fcundly whipped and pickl'd •, after which, they
prov'd very Jioneft and quiet Fellows.

Some time after this, the Boat was order'd ont
ghore, the Tide being up, with the Things promi-
sed to the Men, to which the Captain, at my Inter-
ceflion, caus'd their Chefts and Cloaths to be add-
ed, which they tool?, and were very thankful for 5

it lay in my Way to fend any VeBel to take jthera

When I took Leave of this Ifland, I carryld on
Board for Reliques the great Goat's Skin Cap I
had made, my Umbrella, find one of my Parrots -,
alio I forgot not to take the Money I formerly men-

twenty Years, two Months, and nineteen Days$
being delivered from this fecond Captivity the fame

J went down afterwards into Torkfhhe 5 but my
Father was dead, and my Mother, and ^1 the F3-
ipily extinffc, except that I found two Sifters, and
two of the Children of one of my Brothers * and as
I had been long ago given oyer tor dead, there had!
been no Provifiori made for me $ fp that, in a Word,
I found nothing to relieve or afEft me 5 and that
little Money I had, would not dp much for me, a$
to fettling in the ^orld.

I met ufith ope Piece of Gratitude indeed, which
I did not expedt ; and this was, That the Mailer
of the Ship, who I had fo happily delivered, and
by the fame Means fav d the Ship and Cargo, ha-
ving given a vejpy handfbme Account to the Own-
ers of the Manner how I had fav'd the Lives pf
the Men, and the Ship, they invited me to meet
them, and fame other Merchants concerned, and
all together madeiqe a very handfome Complement
upon the Subjeft, and a Prefent of almoft two
hundred Pounds Sterling.

But after making feveral Reflections upon the
Circumftances of my Life, and how little Way this
Would go towards fettling me in the World, I re*
foly'd to go to Li/fan, and fee if I might not come
by fome Information of the State of my Plantation
in the BraJiU, and of what was become of my Part-
ner, who I had Reafon to fupppfe had fome Years
now given me over for dead.

' With this 'View I took Shipping for Lifbim,
where I am v'd in April following 5 my Man Fri-

ty accompanying me very honeftly in all thdfo
amblings, and proving a n^oft faithful Servant
ppori all Occafions.

When I came to Lijbon, I found out, by Enqui-
ry, and to my particular Satisfaction,, my old Friend-
the Captain of the Ship, who firft took me up z$
§ea, pff of the Shore of Africk : He was noy/r

grown



fm3

grown old, and had left off the Sea, having nut
nis Son, who was far from a young Man, into ni*
Ship * and who ftill irfed fhe Brajil Trade. The
old Man did not know me, and, indeed, I hardly
knew him 5 but I foon brought him to my Re-
membrance, and as foon brought myfelf to his Re-
membrance, when I told him' who I was.

After fome j>ailionate Exprefiions of the old A&
quaintance, I enquir'd, you may be fure, after my
Plantation and my Partner : The old Man told me
he had not been in the Brafils tor about nine Years 5
but that he could aflure me, that when he fame
away, my Partner was living, but the Trufiiees,
who I had join'd with him to take Cognizance of
my Part, were both dead •, that however, he be-
lie vd that I would have a very good Account of
the Improvement of the Plantation •, for that upon
the general Belief of my being' caft away and
drown'd, my Truftees had given in the Account of
the Produce of my Part of the Plantation, to the
Procurator Fifcal •, who had appropriated it, in
Cafe I never caitie to claim it, one Third to the
King, and two Thirds to the Monaftery of St. Au :
gvfiitte, to be expended for the Benefit of the Poor,
and for the Converfion of the Indians to the Catho-
lick Faith •, but that if I appear'd, or any one for
pie, to claim the Inheritance, it ftiould be reftor'd 5
oply that the Improvement, or annual Produftfon,
being diftributed to charitable Ufes, could not be
reftor'd* but he affur'd me, that the Steward of

She King's Revenue (from Lands) and the Provedi-
Idre, fit Steward of the Monaftery , had taken great'
Care all along, that the Incumbent, that is to fay,
my Partfier, gave every Year a faithful Account of
the Produce, of which they received duly mj
Moiety. '



[ 333 3

I afk'd him if he knew to what Height of Inv
provement he had brought the Plantation ? And,
whether he thought it might be worth looking af-
ter * or whether, on my going thither, I ftiould
meet with no Obftru&ion to my pofleffing my juft
Right in the Moiety ?

He told me, he could not tell exa&ly to what
Degree the Plantation was improved -, but this he
knew, that my Partner was grown exceeding rich
upon the enjoying but one Half of it $ and that, to
the beft of his Remembrance, he had heard, that
the King's Third of my Part, which was, it feems,
granted away to fbme other Monaftery, or reli*
gious Houfe, amounted to above two hundred
Moidores a Year * that as to my being reftor'd to a
-quiet Poileflion of it, there was no Queftion to b»
tnade of that, my Partner being aiive to witneft my
Title, arid my Name being alfo enroll'd in tfr?
ftegifter of the Country -, alfo he told me, that
the Survivors of my two Truftees, were very fair
honeft People, and very wealthy ^ and he believ'd
I would not only have their Ailiftance for putting
me in Pofleflion, but would find a very confiderable
Sum of Money in their Hands, for my Account ;
being the Produce of the Farm, while their Fathers
held the Truft, and before it was given up, as a-
bove, which, as he remembered, was for about
twelve Years.

I (hew'd myfelf a little concern'd, and unealy
at this Account, and enquired of the old Captain,
how it came to pals, that the Truftees fhould thus
difpofe of my Effe&s, when he knew that I had
made my Will, and had made him, the Portu-
gttefe Captain, my univerfal Heir, Cfc.

He told me, that was true 5 but that as there
was no Proof of my being dead, he could not a£k
as Executor, until fbme certain Account fhoulcl

come



Cm] .

tome of my Death ^ and that befides, he was not
willing to intermeddle with a Thing fo remote :
That it was true, he had regifter'd my Will,
and put in his Claim 5 and could he have given
any Account of my being dead or alive, he would
hatfe a£ted by Procuration, and taken Pofleffion of
the tvgcvio, ((0 they calFd the Sugar-houfe) and had
given his Son, tfho was now at the BraJiU, Order
to do it.

• But, fays the old Man, I have one Piece of
News to tell yoil, which, perhaps, may not be fo
acceptable to you aft the reft, and that is, That
believing you were loft, and all the World believ-
ing fo alio, your Partner and Truftees did offer
to accompt to me in your Name* for fix or eight
of the firft Years of Profits, Which I refceivds
but there being at that Time, fays he, great Dif-
burfements for increafing thfc Works, building an
ttigertio, and buying Slaves, it did not amount td
near fo much as afterwards it produced : However,
lays the old Man, I fhall give you a true Account
of what I have received in all, and how I have
difpos'dof it.

After a few Days farther Conference with this
ancient Friend, he brought me an Account of the
fix firft Years Income or my Plantation, fignM by
myr Partner, and the Merchants Truftees, being
always deliver'd in Goods, viz. Tobacco in Roll,
and Sugar in Chefts, befides Rum, Moloflus, &c.
which is the Confequence of a Sugar- Work ^ and
I found, by this Account, that every Year the In-
come confiderably increased: but, as above, the
Difburfement being large, the Sum at firft Was
fmall : However, the old Man let me fee, that he
was Debtor to me 470 MoidoreS of Gold, befides
60 Ghefts, of Sugar, and 15 double Rolls of To*
bacco, which were loft in his Ship ; he having beert

fhip-



; C 33 5 3

flwp-wreck'd coming Home to Lijbon, about ti
Years after iny leaving the-Place,

The good Man then began to complain of his
Misfortunes, and how he had been obhg'd to make
Ufe of my Money to recover his Loffes, and buy
him a Share in a new Ship : However, my old
Friepd, fays he, you (hall not want a Supply in
your Neceffity $ and a? icon as my Son returns,
you (ball be fully fetisfy \1. '

Upon this, he pulls out an old Pouch, and gives
me 160 Portugal Moidpies in Gold;- and givini
me the Writing of his Title to the Ship, whic]
his Son was gone to. the Brafih in, of which he
was a Quarter Part Owner, and his Son another,
he puts them both into my Hand's for Security of
the reft.

I was too much mov'd with the Honefty and
Kindnefs of the poor Man, to be able to bear this*,
and remembering what he had done for me, how
he had taken me up at Sea, and how generoufly he
had uled me on all Occafions, and, particularly,
how finoere a Friend he was now to me, I could
hardly refrain weeping at what he faid to me :
Therefore, firft I aflc'd him, if his Circumftances
admitted him to fpare fo much Money at that Time,
and if it would not ftraiten him > He told me, he
could not fay but it might ftraiten him a little 5
but however, it was my Money, and I might want
it more than he.

' Every thing the good Man faid was full of Af-
fection, and I could hardly refrain from Tears
while hefpoke: In fhort, I took ioo of the Moi-
dores, and call'd for a Pen and Ink to give him a
Receipt for them -, then I returned him the reft, and
told him, if ever I had Pofltffion of the Plantation,
1 would return the other to him alfo, as indeed I
afterwards did 5 and that as to the Bill of Sale of

his



his Pah in his Son s Ship, I would not take it by
any Means $ but that if I wanted the Money, I
found he was honeft enough to pay me * and if I
did not, but came to receive what he gave me ReS-
fon to expert, I would never have a Penny more
from him.

When this was pafs'd, the old Man began to aflc
she, if he fhould put me in a Method to make my
Claim to my Plantation ? I told him, I thought to
go over to it my felt : He faid, I might do lb if I
pleas'd 5 but that if I did hot, there were Ways e-
noiigh to fecure my Right, and immediately to ap-
propriate the Profits to myUfei and as there were
Ships in the River of Lifbon, juft ready to go away
to Brafil, he made me enter my Name in a publick
Regifter, with his Affidavit, affirming upon Oath
that I was alive, and that I was the fame Perfon
who took up the Land for the Planting the laid
Plantation at firft*

This being regularly attefted by a Notary, and
a Procuration gftix'd, he directed me to fend it with
a Letter of his Writing, to a Merchant of his Ac-
quaintance at the Place, and then proposed my
Itaying with him 'till an Account came of the Re-
turn.

Never anything was mdre honourable than the
Proceedings upon this Procuration «, for ih lets thad
feven Months I receiv'd a large Packet from the
Survivors of my Truftees the Merchant*, && wkoft
Account I went to Sea, in which Were the follow-
ing particular Letters and Papers enclos'd.

By the fame Fleet, my two Merchant-Truftees
fhipp'd me 1 200 Chefts of Sugar, 800 Rolls of To-
bacco, and the refrof the whole Accompt in Gold,

I might well fay now, indeed, That the latter
End 01 Job was better than the Beginning. It is
impoflible to exprefs the Flutterings of my very
Heart, when I look'd over thefe Letters, and efpe-
cially when I found all my Wealth about me & for
as the Brafil Ships come all in Fleets, the fame
Ships which brought my Letters, brought my
Goods •, and the Ene&s were fafe in the River be-
fore the Letters came to my Hand. In a Word, £
I turn'd pale, and grew lick ; and had not the old
Man run and fetch d me a Cordial, I believe the
fuel den Surprize of Joy had overfet Nature, and I
had dy'd upon the Spot

Nay, after that I continued very ill, and was fb
fome Hours, 'till a Phyfician being fent for, and
fpmething of the real Caufe of my Illnefs being
known, he order'd me to be let Blood 5 after
which I had Relief, and grew well : But I verily
believe, if it had not been eas'd by a Vent given
in that Manner to the Spirits, I ihould have
dy'd.

I was now Matter, all on a fudden, of above
5000 I Sterling in Money, and had an Eftate, as
I might well call it, in the Brafils, of above a
thoufand Pounds a Tear, as fure as an Eftate of
Lands in England: And, in a Word, I was in a
Condition which I (carce knew how to underftand,
or how to compofe my felf for the Enjoyment
of it.

The firft Thing I did, was to recompenfe my
original Benefador, my good old Captain, who
had been firft Charitable to me in my Diftrefs,
Kind to me in the Beginning, and Honeft to me at
the End : I ftiew'd him all that was fent me 1 1

toM



[ 33$ ]

told him, that next to the Providence* of Heaven,
which difpofes all Things, it was owing to him;
and that it now lay on mp to reward him, which
I would do a hundred fold : So I firft return d to
him the hundred Moidores I had received of him,
then I fent for a Notary, and caused him to draw
up a General Releafe or Difcharge for the 470
Moidores, which he had acknowledg'd he ow'd me,
in the fulleft and firmeft Manner pofiible •, after
which, I caused a Procuration to be drawn, im-
powering him to be my Receiver of the annual Pro-
f fits of my Plantation, and appointing my Partner
to accompt to him, and make the Returns by the
ufual Fleets to him in my Name * and a Claufe in
the End, being a Grant of 100 Moidores a Year to
him, during his Life, out of the EfFe&s, and 50
Moidores a Year to his Son after him, for his Life :
And thus I requited my old Man.

I was now to confider which Way to fteer my
Courfe next, and what to do with the Eftate that
Providence had thus put into my Hands j and, in-
deed, I had more Care upon my Head now, than
I had in my filent State of Life in the Ifland,
where I wanted nothing but what I had, and
had nothing but what I wanted : Whereas I had
now a great Charge upon me, and my Bufinefs
was how to fecure it. I had ne er a Gave now to
hide my Money in, or a Place where it might lye
without Lock or Key, 'till it grew mouldy and
tarnilh'd before any Body would meddle with it :
On the contrary, I knew not where to put it, or.
who to truft with it. My old Patron/ the Cap-
tain, indeed was honeft, and that was the only
Refuge I had.

In the next Place, my Intereft in the Brafls
feem'd to fummon me thither •, but now I cou!4
not tell how to think of going thither, 'till I had

Z 2 fettled



[ J4° ]

fettled my Affairs, and left my Effe&s in forae fafe
Hands behind me. At firft I thought of my old
Friend the Widow, who I knew was honeft, and
would be juft to me •, but then (he was in Years,
and but poor, and, for ought I knew, might be in
Debt 5 lb that, in a Word, I had no Way but to
go back to England my felf, and take my Effefis
with me.

'• It was fome Months however before I refolv'd
opon this •, and therefore, as I had rewarded the
old Captain folly, and to his Satisfa&ion, who had
been my former Benefaftor, fo I began to think of
my poor Widow, whofe Hufband liad been my^
firft Benefaftor, and fhe, while it was in her Power,
my faithful Steward and Inftruftor. So the firft
Thing I did, I got a Merchant in Lijfron to write to
his Correfpondent in London, not only to pay a
Bill, but to go find her out, and carry her in Mo-
ney an hundred Pounds from me, and to talk with
her, and comfort her in her Poverty, by telling her
flie fhould, if I liv'd, have a farther Supply : At
the fame time I fent mv two Sifters in the Coun-
try, each of them an hundred Pounds, they being,
though not in Want, yet not in very good Circum-
ftances * one having been marry'd, and left a Wi-
dow, and the other having a Hufband not fb kind
to her as he lhould be.

But among all my Relations or Acquaintances,
I could not yet pitch upon one, to whom I dorft
commit the Grots of my Stock, that I might go
away to the Brafils, and leave Things fafe behind
me * and this greatly perplex'd me.

I had once a Mind to have gone to the Brafih,
and have fettled my felf there; for I was, as it
were, naturalized to the Place * but I had fome Ht-
tle Scruple in my Mind about Religion, which in-
ftnfibly drew me back, of which I fhall fay mone

preftntly.

prefently. However, it was not Religion that
kept me from going there for the prefent * and a?
I had made no Scruple of being openly of the Re*'
ligion of the Country, all the while I was among
them, fo neither did I yet •, only that now and
then having of late thought more of it, (than foi>
merly) when I began to think of living and dying
among them, I began to regret my having prorefs cl
my felf a Papift, and thought it might not be the
beft Religion to die with.

But, as I have faid, this was not the main Thing
that kept me from going to the Brajils $ but that
really I did not know with whom to leave my Ef-
fects behind me •> fo I refolv'd at laft to go to Eng-
land with it, where, if I arrived, I concluded I fhoufd
pake fome Acquaintance, or find fome Relations
jhat would be faithful to me $ and accordingly I
prepar'd to go for England with all my Wealth.

In order to prepare Things for my going Home, I
firft OhtBraJit Fleet being juft going away) refolv'd
to give Anfwer^s fuitable to the juft and faithful Ac-
count of Things X had from thence $ and firft to the
Prior of St. Avguftiy I wrote a Letter full of Thanks
for their juft Dealings, and the Offer of the 87 2
Mpidpres, which wa$ indifpos'd of j which I defir'd
might be given, 500 to the Monaftery, and 372 to
the Poor, as the Prior fhould dire£fc, defiring the
good Padres Prayers for qa.e, and the like. ^ .

I wrote next a Letter of Thanks to tfiy two
Truftees, with all the Acknpwledgment that fb
much Juftice and Honefty call'd for $ as for fend-
ing them any Prefent, they were far above having
any Occafion of it

LajlK I wrote to my Partner, acknowledging
his Induftry in the Improving the Plantation, and
his Integrity in encreafing the Stock of the Works,
giving him JnftrudHons for his Cuivcre. Q^m*.\w-

mcnt of my Part, according to the Powers I had
left with my old Patron, to whom I defir'd him to
fend whatever became due to me, 'till he fhould
hear from me more particularly * alluring him, that
it was my Intention, not only to come to him, but
to fettle my felf there for the Remainder of my
Life : To this I added a very handfome Prefent of
fome Italian Silks for his Wife and two Daughters,
for fuch the Captain's Son inform'd me he had \
with two Pieces of fine EttgUJh Broad-Cloath, the
beft I could get in Lifbon y five Pieces of black Bays,
and fome Flanders Lace of a good Value.

Having thus fettled my Affairs, fold my Cargoe,
and turn'a all my Effects into good Bills of Ex-
change, my next Difficulty was, which Way to go
to England: I had been accuftom'd enough to the
Sea, and yet I had a ftrange Averfion to going to
England by Sea at that Time-, and though I could
give no Reafon for it, yet the Difficulty encreasM
upon me fo much, that though I had once (hipp'd
my Baggage, in order to go, yet I alter'd my Mind,
and that not once, but two 6t three times*

It is true, I had been very unfortunate by Sea,
and this might be fome of the Reafons : But let
no Man flight the ftrong Impulfts of his own
Thoughts in Cafes of fuch Moment : Two of the
Ships which I had fingVd out to go in, I mean,
more particularly fingfd out than any other, that
is to fay, lb as in one of them to put my Things on
Board, and in the other to have agreed with the
Captain •, I fay, two of thefe Ships mifcarry'd, vh.
one was taken by the Algerines, and the other was
caft away on the Start neat Torbay, and all the Peo-
ple drown'd except three * fb that in either of thole
Veffels I had been made miferable, and in which
moft, it was hard to fay.

Having



t 5*3 3

Haying been thus harafs'd in my Thoughts, my
old Pilot, to whom I communicated every thing*
prefs'd me eameftly not to go by Sea * but either
to go by Land to the Qroyne, and crofs over the
Bay of Bifcay to RocbeU, bom whence it was but
an eafy and fafe Journey by Land to Paris, and fo
to dZoiVand Dover •, or to go up to Madrid, and fo
all the Way by Land through France.

In a Word, I was fo prepoflefs'd againft my going
by Sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that
I refblv d to travel all the Way by Land * which,
as I was not in Hafte, and did not value the
Charge, was by much the pleafanter Way * and to
make it more lb, my old Captain brought an Eng-
UJb Gentleman, the Son of a Merchant in Liftott,
who was willing to travel with me : Afier which.
we pick'd up two more Englijb Merchants alfo, ana
two young Portuguese Gentlemen, the laft going to
Paris only * lb that we were in all fix of us, and
five Servants^ the two Merchants and the two
Portuguefe contenting themfelves with one Servant
between two, to fave the Charge 5 and as for me,
I got an EngUJh Sailor to travel with me as a Ser-
vant, befides my Man Friday, who was too much
a Stranger to be capable of fupplying the Place of
a Servant on the Road.

In this Manner I let out from Lifbon -, and our
Company being all very well mounted and arm'd,
we made a little Troop, whereof they did me the
Honour to call me Captain, as well becaufe I was
the oldeft Man, as becaufe I had two Servants,
and, indeed, was the Original of the whole Jourr
ney.

As I have troubled you with none of my Sea
Journals, (b I (hall trouble you now with none of
iny Land Journal : But fome Adventures that hap-

Z 4 pend



[ 344 ]

pfen'd to us in this tedious and -difficult Journey, I
fauft not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we being all of us
Strangers to Spain, were willing to ftay fb«ie Time
to fee the Court of Spain, and to fae what was
Worth obferving •, but it being the laker Part of
the Summer, we haften'd away, arid let out froni
Madrid about the Middle of OSober .* But when we
came to the Edge of Navarre, vr& wterfc alarm'd at
feveral Towns on the Way, with an Account, that
fo much Snow was fallen on the French Side of the
Mountains, that feveral Travellers were obliged
to come back to Pampehma, after hfcvitog attempted;
at an extreme Hazard, to pafc on. . ■' '

When we came to Pampeluna itfelf, we found it
fo indeed ; and to me that had been always ufed
to a hot Climate, and indeed to Countries wher*
We could fcarce bear any Cloaths qh> the Cold wa*
infiiffarable ; nor, indeed, was it more* 1 painful than 7
it was furprizing, to come but ten Days-before out
of the Old Caftile, where the Weather was not onfy
warm, but very hot * and immediately to feel a
Wind from the Pyrenean Mountains, To very keen^
fo feverely cold, as to be intolerable, and to en-
danger benumbing and perilling of our Fingers
and Toes.

Poor Friday was really frighted when he (aw the
Mountains all coverd with Snow, and felt cold
Weather, which he had never feen or felt before
in his Life.

To mend the Matter, when we came to Pam»
pchna, it continu d fnowing with fo much Vio
lence, and fo long, that the People faid, Winter
Was come before its Time, and the Roads, which
■were difficult before^ were npw quite unpayable-,
for, in a Word, the Snow lay in fome Places too

thick for us to travel -, and being not hard frozen,

.... as

as ft the Qle in Northeni Countijiey, there was nj*
going without being in Danger of being bury'"
^live every Step. We ftaid no lefs than twenty-
Days at Pampdnna ^ when (feeing the Winter com-
ing on, and no Likelihood of its being better, for
it was the fevereft Winter all over Europe that had
been known in the Memory of Man; I propos'd
that we fhould all go away to Fojrterabia, and there
take Shipping* for Sourdecmx 9 which was a very
Httle Voyage.

But while wfc were, confidering this, there came
in four French Gentlemen, who having been ftopp'd
bn the French Side of the Pafle9, as we were on tnfe
Spcrnifh, had foutfci out ft Guide, who traverfing the
Country near the Head of Languedac, had brought
them over the Mountains by fuch Ways, that
they were not much incommoded with the Snow$
and where they met with Snow in any Quantity,
they faid it was frozen hard enbugh to bear them
and their Horfes.

We fent for this Guide, who told us, he would
undertake to carty us the fame Way, with no H**
prd from the Snow, provided we Were arm'd fuf-
ficiently to pyoted us from wild Beafts •, for,, he
£kid, upon thefe great Snows, it was frequent fo?
fome Wolves to Ihow themfelves at the Foot of
the Mountains, : being made ravenous for Want of
Food, the Ground being . cover'd with Snow : We
told him we were well enough prepard for fuch
'Creatures as they were, if he would enfure us from
a TGnd of two legged Wolves, which, we were told,
we were in 'mofi: Danger from, efpecially on the
French Side of the Mountains.
' He fatisfy'd us there was no Danger of that Kind,
in the Way that we were to go : So we readily a-
greed to follow him, as did alio twelve other Gen-

tlemen, with their Servants, fomc French, fome iSjpo-
fdfij who, as I faid, had attempted to go, and
were oblisfd to come back again.

Accordingly, we all fet out from Pampehma, with
our Guide, on the fifteenth of November $ and in-
deed, I was furpriz'd, when inftead of going for-
ward, he came dire&ly back with us, on the fame;
Road that we came from Madrid, above twenty
Miles * when, being pafs'd two Rivers, and come
into the plain Country, we found ourfelves in a
warm Climate again, where the Country was plea-
fant, and no Snow to be feen * but on a fudden,
turning to the Left, he approach'd the Mountains
another Way $ and though it is true, the Hills and
Precipices look'd dreadral, vet he made lb many
Tours, fuch Meanders, and led us by fuch wina-
^ing^ Ways, that we were infenfibly pafs'd the
Height of the Mountains, without being much
incumber'd with the Snow* and all on a fudden
he fhew'd us the pleafant fruitful Provinces of Lan-
gttedoc and Gtfcotgn, all green and flourilhing ; tho*
indeed it was at a great Diftance, and we had fomc
rough Way to pais yet.

We were a little uneafy however, when we found
it fnow'd one whole Day, and a Night, fb feft,
that we could not travel •, but he bid us be eafy,
we fliould fbon be paft it all : We found, indeed,
that we began to defcend every Day, and to come
more North than before ; and fb depending upon
our Guide, we went on.

It was about two Hours before Night, when
our Guide being fomething before us, and not juft
in Sight, out rufh'd three monftrous Wolves, and
after them a Bear, out of a hollow Way, adjoyn-
ing to a thick Wood ; two of the Wolves flew up-
on the Guide, and had he been half a Mile before
us, he had been devoured indeed, before we could

have

have help'd him : One of them faften'd upon his
Horfe, and the other attacked the Man with that
Violence, that he had not Time, or not Prefence
of Mind enough to draw his Piftol, but hollow'd
and cry'd out to us moll luftily 5 my Man Friday
being next to me, I bid him ride up, and fee what
was the Matter ; as foon as Friday came in Sight
of the Man, he hollow'd as loud as t'other, Ma-
Jfer! Mafierl But like a bold Fellow, rode di-
re&ly up to the poor Man, and with his Piftol
{hot the Wolf that attack'd him into the Head.
' It was happy for the poor Man, that it was my
Man Friday * for he having been ufed to that
kind of Creature in his Country, had no Fear upon
him -, but went clofe up to him, and fhot him, as
above * whereas any of us would have fir'd at a far-
ther Diftance, and nave, perhaps, either mifs'd the
Wolf, or endangered (hooting the Man.

But it was enough to have terrify d a bolder
Man than I, and indeed it alarm' d all our Compa-
ny, when with the Noife of Fridays Piftol, we
heard on both Sides the difmalleft Howling of
Wolves, and the Noife redoubled by the Eccho of
the Mountains, that it was to us as if there had
been a prodigious Multitude of them \ and perhaps,
indeed, there was not fuch a few, as that we had
no Caufe of Apprehenfions.

However, as Friday had kill'd this Wolf, the o-
ther, that had faften'd upon the Horfe, left him im-
mediately, and fled j having happily faften'd upon
his Head, where the Bofles of the Bridle had ftuek
in his Teeth •, fo that he had not done him much
Hurt : The Man, indeed, was moft hurt * For the
raging Creature had bit him twice, once on the
Arm, and the other Time a little above his Knee •,
and he was juft as it were tumbling down by the

Diforder of his Horfe, when Friday came up and
fhot the Wolf.

It is eafy to fuppofe, that at the Noife of Fri-
day's Piftol, we all mended bur Pace, and rid up as
fait as the Way (which was very difficult) would
give us Leave, to fee what was the Matter * a? fbon
as we came clear of the Trees, which blinded us
before, we faw clearly what had been' the Cafe,
and how Friday had difengagM the poor {jurfe;
though we did not prefently difcerri what Kiod of
Creature it was he had kill d.

But never was a Fight manag'd fb hardily, an4
infuch a furprizing Manner, ziitizi which followil
between Friday and the Bear, which gave us all
(though at fir ft we were furpriz'd and afraid for
him) the greateft Diverfion imaginable. As the
Bear is a heavy, clumfey Creature, and does not
gallop as the Wolf does, who is fwift and light \
io he has two particular Qualities, which generally
aye the Rule or his Addons* Fh /, As to Men, who "<
are not his proper Prey, I fay, not his proper Prey,
bccaufe,tho* I can't £ay what excejllve Hunger might
do, which was now their Cafe, the Ground being
all covered with Snow \ but as to Men, "he does not
ufqally attempt them, imlefs they firft attack him :
On the contrary, if you meet hiinln.theWoods } if
you dont meddle with him, he won't meddle with
you ^ but then you mud take Care to be very civil
to him, and give him the Road \ for he is a very
nice Gentleman, he won't go a Step out of his Way
for a Prince 5 na3% if you are really afraid your
beft Way is to look another Way, and keep going
on s for iometimes, if you ftop, and ftand ftill, and
|ook fteadily at him, he takes it for an Affront \ but
if you throw or tofs anything at him, and it hits
Jiim, though it were but a Bit of a Stick as big as
your Finger, he takes it for an Affront, and fets all

his

his other Bufinefs afide to purfue his Revenge $
for he will have Satisfaction in Point of Honour 5
that is his firft Quality: The next is, That if he
be once affronted, he will never leave you, Night
or Day, till he has his Revenge * but follows at
a good round Rate, till he overtakes you.

My Man Friday had deliver'd our Guide, and
whence came up to him, he was helping him off
frcm his Horfe ^ for the Man was both hurt and
frighted, and indeed the laft more than the firft ^
when on the fudden, we fpy'd the Bear come out
of the Wood, and a vaft monftrous one it was, the
fciggeft by far that ever I fk\y\ We were all a little
lurpriz^d when we faw him $ but when Friday faw
him, it was eafy to fee Joy and Courage in the Fel-
loes Countenance * 7 0! / fays Friday^ three
Times, pointing to him •, Mafter ! Tou give me it
Leave, me Jhakee te Hand with him ; tne make you good
\augh.

I was furpriz'd to fee the bellow fo pleased -, Tou
fool jfotr, fays I, be will eat you np : Eatee me up !
Eatee me up! fays Friday^ twice over again •, Ma
eatee him up : Me make you good Laugh: Tou.aU Jfay
here, me Jhow you good \Laiigh>: So down he fits, aria
gets his Boots off in a Moment, and put on a Paijf
t>f Pumps, (as we call the flat Shoes they wear)
and which he had in his Pocket, gives my pthe*
Servant his Hbrie, and, with his Gun, away he flew,
fwift like the Wind.

The Bear was walking fqfUy on, and offend to
meddle with no Body, till Friday coming pretty
near, calls to hini, as if the feear could underftand
him-, Hark ye* bark ye, fays Friday, mefpeakee wit
you: We followed at a Diftajice 5 for now being,

Friday, who had, as wefay, the Heels of the Bear,
came tip with him quickly, and takes op a great
Stone, and throws at him, and hit him juft on the
Head * but did him no more Harm, than if he had
thrown it againft a Wall * but it anfwer'd Fridajt
End s for the Rogue was lb void of Fear, that ne
did it purely to make the Bear follow him, and
{how ns fome Laugh, as he call'd it.

Asfoon as the tor felt the Stone, and fa whim,
he turns about, and comes after him, taking devi-
lilh long Strides, and fhuffiing along at a mange
Kate, fo as would put a Horfe to a middling Gal-
lop * away runs Friday, and takes his Courfe, as if
he run towards us for Help* fo we all refolvd to
fire at once upon the Bear, and deliver my Man \
iho' I was angry at him heartily for ^ bringing
the Bear back upon us, when he was going about
his own Bufinels another Way ; and efpeaally I
was angry that he had turn d the Bear upon us, and
then run away -, and I call'd out, Tom Dog, faid I,
is this your making us laugh ? Come amy, and take your
Horfe, that we mayjboot the Creature^ he hears me,
and crfes out, No Jhoot, no jhoot, ftand JKH you get
much Laugh. And as the nimble Creature run two
Foot for the Beaft s one, he turn d on a Hidden, on
one Side of us, and feeing a great Oak-Tree, fit for
his Purpofe, he beckon'd to us to follow, and dou-
bling his Pace, he gets nimbly up the Tree, laying
his Gun down upon the Ground, at about five or
fix Yards from the Bottom of the Tree.

The Bear foon came to the Tree, and we fol-
lowed at a Diftance ; the firft Thing he did, he
ftopp'd at the Gun, fmelt to it, but let it lie, and
up he fcrambles into the Tree, climbing like a Gat,
tho' fo monftroufly heavy : I was amazM at the
Folly, as I thought it, of my Man, and could not
for my Life fee any Thing to laugh at yet, till fee*

ing the Bear get up the Tree, we all rode nearer to
him.

? When we came to the Tree, there was Friday
got out to the fmall End of a large Limb of the
Tree, and the Bear got about halt Way to him *
as loon as the Bear got out to that Part where the
Limb of the Tree was weaker, Ha, fays he to us,

l now you fee me teacbee the Bear dance * fo he falls a

" jumping and {baking the Bough, at which the Bear
began to totter, but flood ftill, and began to look
behind him, to fee how he fhould get back $ then
indeed we did laugh heartily : But Friday had not

.. done with him by a great deal * when he fees him
ftand ftill, he calls out to him again, as if he had

1 fuppos'd the Bear could {peak Englijb * What, you
no come farther ? Pray you come farther $ fo he left
jumping and (baking the Bough ; and the Bear, juft
as it he had understood what he {aid, did come a

I little farther, then he fell a jumping again, and

} the Bear ftoppM again.

We thought now was a rood Time to knock him
on the Head, and I call'd to Friday to ftand ftill,
and we would (hoot the Bear* but he cry'd out
earneftly, Opray! Opray! nojboat, me /boot by and
then % he would have faid, by and by. However, to
fhorten the Story, Friday danc'd fo much, and
the Bear ftood fo ticklifh, that we had laughing •
enough indeed, but ftill could not imagine what
the Fellow would do * for firft we thought he de-
pended upon {baking the Bear off* and we found
the Bear was too cunning for that too * for he
would not go out far enough to be thrown down,
but clings faft with his great broad Claws and
Peet, fo that we could not imagine what would
be the End of it, and where the Jeft would be at
laft.

. . . But.



But Friday jput us out of Doubt quickly ; for
feeing the Bear cling faft to the Bough, and that
be would not be perfwaded to c$ttne any farther 5
Well, veil, fays Friday, you no tome farther, me go i
me go •, you no crime to me, me go eometoyou \ and upon
this, he goes out to the fmalkft End of the Bough,
where it would bend with his Weight, and gently
lets himfelf down by it, Aiding down the -Bough*
till he came near enough to jump dowtton his Feet,
and away he tun to his Gun, taies it up* *nd
ftands ftilL

Well, faid I to him* Ftiday^h&t wil\,ytm dp
now ? Why don't you Ihoot him? JSfoJbodt* Jays
Friday, tto yet i me {hoot now, msnoktil ! * me flajf, pve
you one more Laugh : And indeed, (b he did, &* yoft
will fee prefently j for when the Bear feeJwlW
my gone, he comes back from the Bough wh^reic
ftcxxl -, but did it mighty leifurely, looting behind
him every Step, and coming backward till he got
into the Body of the Tree * then with the fame
hinder End forenloft, he come down thfe Tree,
grafping it with his Claws, and moving one Foot
at a Time, veky leifurely ; at t his Jun&ure, and juft
before he could fet his hind Feet tipon. the Ground,
Friday ftepp d clofe to him* clapp'd the Muzzel of
his Piece into his Ear, and fhot him dead as a
Stone.

Then the Rogue twrn'd about,, to fee if we did
not laugh, and when be faw we were plebsd by
our Looks* he falls a laughing himfelf very loud *
5b we kill Bear in my Country, fays Friday $ (b jroii
kill them, fays I, why you have no Gun*: itf^
fays he, vo Gun, bkt Jhoot great much long. Arrotr,

This was, indeed,. a good Diverfion.to us; but'
we were flill in 4 wild Place, and^tmr Guide Very
much hurt, and what to do we hardly knew 5 tte 1

deed, eiCept the Noife I once hferd on the Shore
of Africa, of which I have faid fbmething already,
I never heard any thing that fill'd me with fo much
Hotiropr.

Thefe Things fcnd the Approach of Night, cal-
led us off, or elfe, as Friday would have had us,
we fhould certainly have taken the Skin of this
monftrtms Creature of£ which was worth faving*
but we had three Leagues to go, and our Guide
haften'd us $ lb we left him, and went forward on
our Journey.

The Ground was ftill cover'd with Snow, tho*
not fo deep and dangerous as on the Mountains,
and the ravenous Creatures, as we heard after-
wards, were come down into the Foreft and plain
Country, prefifd by Hunger to leek for Food $ and
had done a great deal of Mifchief in the Villages,
Where they (Wrpriffd the Country People, kill'd a
great many of their Sheep and Horfes, and fome
People too.

we had one dangerous Place to pafs, which
our Guide told us, if there w$re any more Wolves
in the Country, we fhould find them there -, and
this was in a (mail Plain, furrounded with Woods
on every Side, and a long narrow Defile or Lane,
which we were to pafs to get through the Wood,
and then we Ihould come to the Village where we
were to lodge.

It was within half an Hour of Sun-fet when we
enter'd the firft Wood, and a little after Sun-fet,
When we came into the Plain. We met with no-
thing in the firft Wood, except, that in a little
Plain within the Wood, which was not above two
Furlongs over, we faw five great Wolves crofs the
Road, rail Speed one after another, as if they had
Been in Chaot of fome Prey, and had it in View,

A a they






Cm]

they took no N^ice of us, and werd gone, and
oat of our .Sight in a few Moments
. Upon this our Guide, who, by the Way, was a
wretched fainthearted Fellow, bid us keep in a
ready Pofture * for he believ'd there were more
Wolves a coming.

We kept our Arms ready, and our Eyes about us,
but we faw no more Wolves, 'till we came thro'
that Wood whicfy was near half a League, and en-
tered the Plain ;•• As foon as we came into the Plain,
we had Occafion enough to look about us ^ the
firft Objed we met with was a dead Horfe $ that
is to fay, a poor Horfe which the Wolves had
feiird, and at lead a Dozen of them at Work •, we
could not fay eating of him, but picking of his
Bones rather, for they had eaten up all the Flelh
before.

We did not think fit to difturb them at their
Feaft $ neither did they take much Notice of us :
Friday would have let fly at them, but I would,
not fuffer him by any Means •, for I found we
were like to have more Bufinefs upon our Hands
than we were aware of. We were not gone half
over the Plain, but we began to hear the Wolves
howl in the Wood on our Left, in a frightful
Manrfer, and prefently after we faw about a hun-
dred coming on dire£tty towards us, all in a Body,
and moft of them in a Line, as regularly as an
Army drawn up by experienced Officers. I fcarce
knew in what Manner to receive them •, but found
to draw our felves in a clofe Line was the only
Way * fb we form'd in a Moment : But that we
might not have too much Interval, I order'd,
that only every other Man fhould fire, and that
the others who had not fir'd fhould ftand ready,
to giye them a fecond Volley immediately,, if
they continued to advance upon us, and that then

thof #



t



55* J ,

thofe who had fir'd at firft, fhouH not pretend to
load their Fufees again, but ftand ready with every
one a Piftpl * for we were all arm'd with a Fufee;
and a Pair of Piftols each Man $ Co we were by
this Method able to fire fix Volleys, half of us at
a Time ; however, at prefent we had no Neceffi-
ty •, for upon firing the firft Volley, the Ehemy
made a foil Stop, being terrify 'd as well with the
Noife as with the Fire * four of them beinfe fhot
into the Head, dropp'd* feveral others were wound-
ed, and went bleeding off, as we could fee by the
Snow : I found they ftopp'd, but did not immedi-
ately Retreat ; whereupon remembring that I h^d
been told, that the fierceft Creatures were tern-
fy'd at the Voice of a Man, I caus'd all our Com-
pany to hollow as loud as we could, and I found
the Notion not altogether miftakeri-, for upon but
Shout, they began to retire, and turn about •, thep
I order 'd a fecond Voile y to be fir'd in their Rear;
which put them to the Gallop, and away they
went f 6, the Woods.

This gave us Leifure to charge our Pieces again,
and that we might lofe no Time, we kept going 5
but we had but little more than loaded our Fufees;
and put our felvcs into a Readinefs, when we heard
a terrible Noife in the fame Wood, on our Left,
only that it was farther onward the fame Way we
were to go.

The Night was coming on, and the Light be-
gan to be dufky, which made it worfe on our Side :
^ut the Noife eiicreafing, we could eafily perceive
that it was the howling and yelling of thofe hel-
jifh Creatures * and on a fudden, we perceivd twa
or threje Troops of Wolves^ one on our Left, one be?
hind iis, and one on our Front •, fo that we feem?itg|
be furrounded with 'em * ? however, as they did not
fell upon iis, we kept our Way forward^ &&&'*&

£ a 1 ^>



[55«]

We could make our Horfes go, which, the Way be-
ing very rough, was only] a good large Trot •, and
in this Manner we came in View of the Entrance
of a Wood, through which we were to pals, at the
farther Side of the Plain * but we were greatly fur*
priz d, when coming nearer the Lane, or Pals, we
law a confus'd Number of Wolves (binding juft at
the Entrance.

On a fudden, at another opening of the Wood,
\fe heard the Noife of a Gun * and looking that
Way, out rufh'd a Horfe, with a Saddle and a
Bridle on him, flying like the Wind, and fixteen
or feventeen Wolves after him, full Speed ; indeed,
the Horfe had the Heels of them * but as we (up-

n*d that he could not hold it at that Rate, we
ibted not but they would get up with him at laft,
and no queftion but they did.

But here we had a raoft horrible Sight $ for ri*
ding up to the Entrance where the Horfe came out,
we round the Carcafs of another Horfe, and of two
Men, devoured by the ravenous Creatures, and one
of the Men was no doubt the fame who we heard
fir'd the Gun ; for there lay a Gun juft by him, fir'd
off-, but as to the Man, his Head ancf the upper
Part of his Body was eaten up.

This fiird us with Horror, and we knew not
what Courfe to take, but the Creatures refblv'd us
foon * for they gathered about us prefently, in Hopes
of Prey, and I verily believe there were three hun-
dred of them : It happen'd very much to our Ad-
vantage, that at the Entrance into the Wood, but
a little Way from it, there lay fome large Timber
Trees, which had been cut down the Summer be-
fore, and I fuppofe lay there for Carriage : I drew
my little Troop in among thofe Trees, and placing
our felves in a Line, behind one long Tree, I ad-
vis'd them all to light, and keeping that Tree be-
fore



C 357 3

fore us, for a Breaft-Work, to ftand in a Trian-
gle, or three Fronts, enclofing our Horfes in the
Center.

We did fb, and it was well we did * for never
was a more furious Charge than the Creatures
made upon us in the Place; they came on us with
£ growling kind of a Noife (and mounted the Piece
of Timber, which, as I faid, was our Breaft-Work)
as if they were only ruftiing upon their Pjey -, and
this Fury of theirs, it feems, was principally occa-
fion'd by their feeing our Horfes behind us, which
was the Prey they aim'd at : I order'd our Men to
fire as before, every other Man •, and they took
their Aim fo fure, that indeed they kill'd feveral
of the Wolves at the firft Volley ^ but there was. a
Neceffity to keep a continual Firing -, for they
came on like Devils, thofe behind pulhing on thofe
before.

When we had fir'd our fecond Volley of our Fu-
fees, we thought they ftopp d a little, and I hop'd
they would have gone off* but it was but a fo-
ment \ for others came forward again ^ fb we fir'd
two Volleys of our Piftols, and I believe in thefe
four Fjrings, we had kill'd feventeen or eighteen of
them, and laitfd twice as many j yet they came on
again.

I was loath to fpend our laft Shot too haftily * fb
I call'd my Servant, not rny Man Friday, for he was
better employed •, for with the greateft Dexterity-
imaginable, he had charc'd my Fufee and his
own, while we were engag'a -> but as I faid, I call'd
my other M^n, and giving him a Horn of Powder,
I bad him lay a Train, alfalong the Piece of Tim-
ber, and let it be a large Train : He did fo, and had
but juft Time to get away, when the Wolves came
ipp to It, and fbme were got up upon it •, when
~ fnapping an uncharg'd Piftol clofe to \Y^^«-



C 35» 3

der, fet it on fire * thofe that were upon the Tim-
ber were fcorchM with it, and fix or {even of then}
fell, or rather jump'd in among us, with the Force
and Fright ot" the Fire 5 we difpatch'd thefe in
an Inftant, and the reft were fo frighted with the
Light, which the Night (for it was now very near
Dark) made more terrible, that they drew back
a little.

Upon which I order'd our laft Piftol to be fir'd
offin one VollSy, and after that we gaye a Shout ^
upon this the Wolves tprn'd Tail, and we fally*d
immediately upon near twenty lame ones, whp
we found ftruggling on the Ground, and fell a cut-
ting them with our Swords, which anfwer'd our
Expectation •, for the Crying and Howling they
made was better underftopd by their Fellows > 10
that they all fled and left u$.
' We had, firft and laft, kilfd about threefcore
of them •, and had it been Day-Light, we had
kilPd many more* The Field of Battle being thus
clear d, we made forward again * for we had ftill
near a League to go. We heard the ravenous Crea-
ture^ howl and yell in tlie Woods as we went, fe-
yeral Times-, and fomet^mes we fancy'd we faw
fome of them •, but the Snow dazling ojir Kyes,
we were not certain : So in about an Hour more,
we came to the Town where we were to lodge,
which we found in a terrible Fright, and all 19
Arms ^ for it feems, that the Night before, the
Wolves and fome IJears had broke into the Village,
and put them in a terrible Fright ; and they were
oblig dtp keep Guard Night and Day, but efpeci-
ally in the Night, to preferve their Cattle, and
indeed their People. V»

The nest Morning our Guide was fo HL and hi?
Limbs fwellM with the rankling of hi? two WoundsL
that he could go no farther j fo we were obliged to
•■■■■ «• • tjake



[ 3 *9 J

fake a new Guide there, and go to Tholoufe, wherd
we found a warm Climate, a fruitful plealant Coun*
try, and no Snow, no Wolves, or any Thing like
them ^ but when we told our Story at ibolovfe^ they
told us it was nothing but what was ordinary in the
great Foreft at the Foot of the Mountains, efpeci-
ally when the Snow lay on the Ground : But they
enquired much what kind of a Guide we had gotten,
that would venture to bring us that Way in fuch
a fevere Seafon •, and told us, it was very much
ive were not all devoured. When we told them how
we placed ourfelves, and the Horfes in the Middle,
the}'- blarnd us exceedingly, and told us it was fifty
to one but we had been all deftroy'd •, for it was the
Sight of the Horfes which made the Wolves fb fu-
rious, feeing their Prey $ and that at other Times
they arc really afraid of a Gun; but the being ex*
ceifive hungry, and raging on that Account, the
Eagernefs to come at the Horfes had made them
fenftlefs of Danger $ and that if we had not by the
continu'd Fire, and at laft by the Stratagem of the
Train ot Powder, mafte^d them, it had been great
Odds but that we had been torn to Pieces * where-
as had we been content to have fat ftill on Horfe-
back, and fir'd as Horfemen, they would not have
taken the Horfes For fo much their own, when Men
were on their Backs, as otherwife ; and withal,
they told us, that at laft, if we had flood altoge-
ther, and left our Horfes, they would have been
fo eager to have devour'd them, that we might have
come off fafe, efpecially having our Fire Arms in
our Hands, and being lo many in Number.

For my Part, I was never fb fenfible of Danger
in my Life $ for feeing above three hundred Devils
come roaring and epen mouth'd to devour us,* and
having nothing to fhelter us, or retreat to^ I gave
inyfelf ovpr w loft * and a& . it was, I believe^!



Stall never care to crofs the Mountains again * I
think I would much lather go a thoufand Leagues
by Sea, tho' I were fure to meet with a htorm
once a Week.

I have nothing uncommon to take Notice o£ w
my PafTage thro" JFratrc* ^ nothing but what other
Travellers have given an Acount of, with much
more Advantage than I can. I travel! <i from Tkm>
hufe to Parity and without any conliderable Stay,
came to Callais, and landed fafe at Dover, the
fourteenth of January after haying had a feveie
cold Seafon to travel in.

I was now come to the Center of my Travels,
and had in a little Time all my new diicover d fi-
liate fafe about me, the Bills of Exchange which I
brought with me having been very currently pai*L

My principal Guide, and Privy Counccllor, was
my good ancient Widow, who, in Gratitude for the
Money I had fent her, thought no Pains too much,
or Care too great, to employ for me •, and I trufteii
her fo entirely with every Thing, that I was. per?
fe&ly eafy as to the Security of my Effe&s* ancL
indeed, I was very happy from my Beginning, and
now to the End, in the unfpotted Integrity of this
good Gentlewoman.

And now I began to think of leaving my Efie$s
with this Woman, and fetting out for Liflott, and
fo to the BraJUs^ but now another Scruple came in
my Way, and that was Religion •, for as I had en-
tertaiu'd fome Doubts about the Roman Religion,
even while I was abroad, efpecially in my State of
Solitude ; fo I knew there was no going to the Bra-
fh for me, much It ft going to fettle there, unlefs I
refolv'd to embrace the Roman Catholick Religion,
•without any Referve; unlefs, on the other Hand,
I refolv d to be a Sacrifice to my Principles, be t
Martyr for Religion, and die in the Inquifition * fo



[ 3«« ]

I refolv'd to ftay at Home, and if I could find
Means for it, todifpofe of my Plantation. ^

To this Purpofe, I wrote to my old Friend at
£t/£wf, who in Return gave ine Notice, that he
could eafily difpofe of it there ; But that if I
thought fit to give him Leave to offer it in my
Name to the two Merchants, the Survivors <xf my
Truftees, who liv d in the Brajils, who muft fully
underftand the Value of it, who liv'd juft upon the
Spot, and who I knew were very rich, fo that he
believ d they would be fond of buying it, he did
not doubt, but I fhould make 4 or 5000 Pieces df
Eight the more of it.

Accordingly I agreed, gave him Order to offer it
to them, and he did fo * and in about 8 Months •
more, the Ship being then rpturn'd, he fent me aft
Account that they had accepted the Offer, and
had remitted 33000 Pieces of Eight to a Corre-
fpondent of theirs at Li/bon, to pay for it

In Return, I fign'd the Inftrument of Sale in the
Form which they fent from lijbm^ and fent it to
my old Man, who fent me Bills of Exchange for
3288000 Pieces of Eight to pie, for the Eftate •, re-:
ferving the Payment of 100 Moidores a Year to
jrim, the old Man, during his Life, and 50 Moi-
dores afterwards to his Son for his Life, which I
had promised thpm, which the Plantation was to
make pood as a Rent-Charge. And thus I have
given the firft Part of a Life of Fortune and Ad-
venture, a Life of Providences ChecquerAVbrk,
and of a Variety which the World will feldbiii be
able to ftiow the like of: Beginning f oolifhly, .but
clofing much more happily than any Part of it evey
gave me Leave fo much as to hope for.

Any one would think, that in this State of com r
^Kcated good Forttme, I was paft running any
more Hazards ; and fo indeed I had been. \Cc&W
